@stillgray @pixiejenni i agree everyone in #gamergate should be more inclusive and play games feminists approve eg. motorboat a stranger
@feministshit faster? really? is that why there are separate race events for women? more precise? men score much higher on spacial relations
@justin_boening the thing is feminism had so many different branches and most intersectional feminists will call out radfems anti man
@stephaniecp93 when did anyone in the west get stoned to death for adultery? 2nd wave feminists are solely concerned w/white western women.

@feministcampus @femfreq but there is no evidence to prove #gamergate did it

These hysterical women would benefit from listening to @DennisPrager. Women should learn to control their emotional, irrational female side the way men have learned to control their aggressive, sexual nature. Men are quite obviously the more evolved of the sexes in this regard.
The thing is if a woman speaks out about rape on Nigerian twitter.The backlash would be shocking. It's not good for the mind. Hence silence

@chsfword I'm guessing you learned of feminism from Beyonce.
.@JamieAgathaRose  Nothing.  I like women in pink. It's a tipoff that they don't angrily reject femininity like...ahem, well, you know.
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm It says women must stay at home and not display themselves.
"girls" @Dehner07 In usually not sexist, but girls are refs in the NBA ? Wow.
Actually Nikki really is quite good looking, wait till my shots hit the newstand! #mkr #photography #fashion
@DanaSheehan I agree, but that's because you as a woman have MORE legal rights than I do.  So that WOULD be great.
Actually, they're not! Your mistake. @ruffelldan @JoeyG__ it's beyond all comprehension . Girls are just rubbish at geography #notsexist

"More welcoming" only to the divorced and remarried, an infinitesimally small number of Catholics who disobeyed the magisterium in remarrying but are obedient about receiving communion.  This pope is as misogynist and homophobic as the cardinals who elected him and the men he has appointed since. Pope Francis excommunicated Fr. Greg Reynolds for supporting same-sex marriage and women's ordination, fired Fr. Krzysztof Charamsa  from his Vatican post after coming out and refused to accept the appointment of Laurent Stefanini as French ambassador to the Vatican because he was openly gay. Like the pope, Cupich fired two employees, Sandor Demkovich and Colin Collette, for marrying their partners. Cupich defrocked Fr. Marco Mercado because of his “inappropriate relationship with an adult man.” Reform the curia? His first action was to make Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, who supported the military coup against the progressive Zelaya in 2009, as head of his "C9."
Sorry this was a light weight attempt to smear a fine fine organization.  These articles just continue to be recycled, week after week,  month after month  - women priests - Knights = bad - gay priests - married priests - abuse stories recycled - nuns on buses - ex priests - ecochurch  not much left after screening out these type of stories.
What can the Republicans do now, since the majority of their "base" have been encouraged to feed their fears, to fear African Americans, Muslims, LGBT people, to think that disparaging women is just "locker room talk"?  I do think this started with people like McConnell and before that with someone like Gingrich - who turned demonizing the opposition into an art form.  It was fed through the years of the Obama presidency by those who refused to work with Obama or the Democrats in Congress - would rather let the government shut down than compromise.  I know these attitudes do not describe all conservatives - I know quite a few - some in my own family - and they are nice, smart people.  But they shrug this off or agree with one or two of these fears but have bought into the demonizing of Hillary.    Where and how do decent Republicans start over, bring a sense of cohesiveness rather than divisiveness?  I don't know.
I like the cherry picking of articles to support a statement.  Good think Begich isn't running for office.  Typical scare tactics....oh no!!!  ANWR will forever be locked up...unlike now.  Haven't seen much priority in our delegation to unlock it recently.  Oh maybe because right now it's not economically competitive with oil fracked from mostly private lands that the Feds can't and won't regulate.  Trump's a train wreck and if you think he gives a hoot about the common worker or the Alaskan economy then I have some land in Willow to sell you.
Dear RG Editors:  I want to thank you for printing this amazing Eggleston letter.   With enemies  like her, the RG editors must be doing something right.  Totally incoherent, there is no clarification of what exactly she was so horrified by, or even what this cartoon was specifically  about.  She seems to imagine you sit around searching for anything which will upset conservatives, while in fact you print a wild array of opinion pieces here, such as recent  letters claiming that Obama is the Greatest Traitor of All Time  or that Oregon should form a Robert E. Lee-type militia to oppose  the Feds.    But her true "bon mot" was suggesting you were upset because  of  the " tragic deaths of many of their own liberal people"-- evidently  referring to the fact that many  victims were probably LGBT and Hispanic.!
After the  Orlando massacre, gay  leaders of  LGBT communities across America and in Toronto said it had nothing to do with the beautiful  religion of Islam,  and it was  all  because of Trump and the  NRA. Trump identified the killer Mateen as an Islamic terrorist  and that he would work to protect gays in America from it happening again,  but  has been vilified as homophobic for that.
Don't forget it was a LGBTQ+ member who mowed down 49 innocent people in Orlando last week.  They're not all rainbows, lisps and women sporting short hairstyles while wearing comfortable shoes. They're just as hateful and violent as most groups who have the insatiable narcissistic desire for extra special treatment/attention.
First of all--I think they key to understanding the position of the Church is that a person who has a same sex attraction is not bared from seminary and priesthood.  A person who is GAY is bared.  The difference?  A gay person is not able to live a celibate life because they are acting out their attraction.  A heterosexual person who acts out their attractions would also be bared from entering seminary--because such a person does not demonstrate an ability to live celibacy and chastely.    Secondly: is it a news flash that the Church does not support the gay lifestyle?  Why are you surprised to hear the pope reiterate church teaching on this issue?  The pope might be liberal--in the sense that he prefers to emphasize the social teaching of the Church over the moral--but he is not a heretic. His pastoral style might also be different from his predecessors--but again, he is not a heretic.
Hey Nancy, I see the under toads are out in force in the comments...I liked the letter. I was sickened by the lapdogs of the GOP who sniveled up to the "d" in hopes that he will grow up...you know past is prolog and he got his start redlining his Dad's apartments to assure that blacks were not welcome. So it's not surprise to hear the dog-whistle of racism out of his mouth. I do admit and admire his stated support of the LBGTQ community--and yes a few have taken on the queer label in self-defense, but I'm guessing that wasn't his meaning based on his actions.

"On a new batch of recordings from Howard Stern’s radio shows aired Saturday by CNN, Trump said that he would “have no problem” having sex with 24-year-olds, that he “couldn’t care less” if he satisfies the women he sleeps with, that “it’s checkout time” once women reach the age of 35 and that he had engaged in three-way sex."  “Haven’t we all?” Trump told Stern on his SiriusXM satellite radio show in 2008. “Are we babies?”  "Trump also described barging in on nude Miss Universe beauty pageant contestants in their dressing room, characterizing his visits as inspections by the contest’s owner."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/more-trump-tapes-surface-with-crude-sex-remarks/2016/10/08/7129cea2-8d92-11e6-bff0-d53f592f176e_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_howardstern808pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory
This is comment is a perfect example of what is in the real world of 2016.

Recently there was a wonderful article in the Washington Post written by a millennial mainly for Protestant churches, although the thrust of the article could just as easily extend to Roman Catholicism. The title, "Want millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church ‘cool,'" gives the gist of the article, found here:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jesus-doesnt-tweet/2015/04/30/fb07ef1a-ed01-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html?utm_term=.8716a7384258  A couple of quotes: "Millennials are not disillusioned with tradition; they are frustrated with slick or shallow expressions of religion.”  As for why young people leave religion, this supports VictorVictoria's point: "I was looking for a truer Christianity, a more authentic Christianity: I didn’t like how gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people were being treated by my evangelical faith community. I had questions about science and faith, biblical interpretation and theology. I felt lonely in my doubts."

Yep so is killing your children if they back talk, rape is ok, slavery is ok and a whole host of other evil stuff no one would agree is ok. So why aren't people stoning people for mixing cotton with other materials? Rape or slavery isn't even covered in the Ten Commandments. I think it's time society stops using the bible as a source for morality.
"I think it’s actively dishonest and distracting to accuse Bailey of “probably” holding those principles himself. "  So, you can dish it out but you can't take it.  "While I don’t have any personal knowledge of Imago Dei’s principles"  Well gosh, I-PI, maybe you should inform yourself.      If you "passionately" disagree with misogyny and homophobia, perhaps you could take a few minutes and read Ms. Slovic's article as well as taking a quick look at the doctrines espoused on their web page.  You can't support the NRA and gun control at the same time.  You can't support Right to Life and Planned Parenthood at the same time.  You can't give money and support to Imago Dei and then claim to be a feminist.  I don't expect to change your mind, but I hope that I have convinced members of the LGBT and other communities to vote for someone who is not Jules Bailey.
K: I wonder if Trump can imagine his future in the White House now that he won, above some kind of manic fantasy.  I don't worry about the nuclear issue, the SECDEF has to concur.     S: Trump can't undo gay marriage and with his Congress, there will be no ENDA.  Most of the xenophobic stuff was playing to the crowds.  Now that they have been fooled, nothing will come of it.  Junking common core would be lovely.  Of course, the prospect of authoritarianism is troubling, especially as the Donald meets a permanent bureaucracy which will not follow him into lawlessness.  K : Trump is experienced in going with his gut, however if he has any kind of professional staff they will chafe at letting him.  Of course, this gives us the prospect of clever Republican operatives playing him like a fiddle.  Kind of like Cheney played Bush.  The question is, what will Trump do when he figures out he is being handled (and if he won't let himself be handled, what kind of disaster will ensue).
The phrase "family values", as we all know, has been used previously to deny rights to the LGBT as though  denying rights to one group somehow supports the rights of another (zero sum). Nice to see this phrase interpreted from a Catholic perspective instead of a political one whereby support for all types of families is a win-win for all. Afterall, Christ's love is limitless and synergistic; it is not conserved as in the Physics of energy and mass.
In addition, the pastors offer a lot of verbiage that amounts to resentment that LGBTs enjoy equal protection. Well, tough. Every time the circle of sympathy enlarges and civil rights are formally recognized for a previously marginalized group conservatives moan. What else is new under the sun?
Music minister in Rhode Island fired....  New priest comes in.  What had been a quiet acceptance of a gay music minister then becomes a mess.  The priest fires the music minister on learning he is in a legal gay marriage, another employee then quits, lay ministers then resign, and dozens of parishioners quit, including many other LGBT Catholics who thought they had a faith home.  I would think the new priest would consider how the rest of the faithful of the parish were dealing with the music minister.  But, then, that would mean the new priest would care what they thought.  And, of course, it is THAT Bishop Tobin.  There was a choice.  Imagine the priest not firing the gay music minister and preaching on acceptance of all because all are sinners.  No one measures up - certainly not the goody-two-shoes who thought to out the music director.  Why reward that person, who, despite his/her many virtues, is also a sinner?  Doesn't the music director also have other virtues?
We know very little about what Trump will actually do. What we do know is that he likes to incite people and this message struck a cord with the electorate. What scares me is he never takes responsibility for anything, meaning he is always in need of scapegoats. Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT.
We work and live and go to public businesses every day with people and we don't necessarily know their citizenship status or sexual orientation or gender identity but a story on someone makes their identity up for discussion. In the current climate, we have a presidential candidate who calls for deportation of Mexicans, banning Muslims, and that has emboldened many, including some ADN readers, to question Arriaga's immigration status, whether she is following the law, and whether she can vote. We have no legal civil rights protections for LGBTQIA people in our state. Even if a person is "out" or "open" about their identity, to write a story about that identity can subject people to a range of ills from antagonistic comments to eviction, wrongful termination, and being turned out of businesses. I just think writers should be mindful of that.
Except that Francis is really no more welcoming to gays than his immediate predecessors. He hasn't said, "You should not fire gay employees for being civilly married." That's is something he should insist on if he truly means for the Church to be welcoming to LGBTs.
There are federal laws to protect LGBT and the states that have come up with hateful laws in order to oppress LGBT will financially feel the pressure to re-think their opposition and oppressive laws.  Unless you're a member of one of those 'militias' you and I obey the laws and if we think those laws are wrong we use the system and the process available to change the laws.  If you randomly decide which laws you'll obey and which ones you won't obey we will live in chaos and those that don't obey will be put in jail and thats a good thing.
LGBT rights movement has been around since the late 1960s; however in Anchorage the conservative press never told the whole truth about LGBT until after the turn of the century.
The Pope has clearly pointed to Cardinal Schonborn's interpretation as authoritative.  Any confusion is not from a lack of understanding, but disagreement and worse yet disobedience.
As I recall, Shakespeare cast only men in his plays. Even female roles were played by males. This was clearly part of the brutal history of misogyny in western culture. One further insult to women; denying them opportunity simply because of their gender.   Men dressing in women's clothes, then, should represent the same taboo.   Or, do you deny the atrocities men committed against women through history?
Having to fire people for failure to show up to work on time is not an issue of the employees having much higher work ethics and standards. It is the responsibility of the employee to get to work on time. It is responsibility of the employer/management to hold employees accountable; failure to hold ALL employees accountable for the same standards is grounds for discrimination, lawsuits and termination. When one or some employees break the rules and they are not held accountable then all hell breaks loose. If the male is the manager and the female is the employee it can look like sexual harassment. Black employee vs white manager, it can look racial. God forbid one of them might be religious, gay, bi because then there could be grounds for discrimination based on sexual orientation. I have had to terminate people that have long rap sheets where I was literally in fear of my life because of their criminal history. Hiring criminals comes with many hidden dangers. To coworkers & customers.
Remember "live in Ottawa" that the Nuremberg laws of 1935 had already deprived Jews of their citizenship, who by 1936 were stripped of voting rights for Parliamentary elections. Hitler's armies had crossed into the Rhineland, which in 1936 they re-militarized. By seeking trade opportunities with the Nazis, Mackenzie King displayed a terrible lack of principles, not unlike that we see today in the Liberal overtures towards Communist China.     .
Bahahahahahahahahahahaha (Gasping) Please. Stop.
It was actually a personal question directed to Purg.   I think that you give far too much credit to those who hold homophobic views.  The Bible contains much that was believed by the writers, but which has been found to be untrue -- such as the "fact" that the heavens are supported by four pillars.  It's incredible to me that any thinking person could harbor irrational views, based purely on what is written in the Bible.
I do not see how race plays into this conversation?  I find it blatantly obtuse.
So in our Land of the Free, you want people forced to stand for the pledge and flag? Hmmmm. We are not equal, anyone who bashes the LGBT community is NOT a believer in equal rights. Equality for everyone, regardless of color, race or sexuality but nope, we preach hate and ban people from the bathroom they use based on their birth "private parts" - note PRIVATE parts - and not who they love their life as. Equality? Bullshit. Blacks. Women. LGBT. And now you want to punish the NFL financially because you disagree with one player. Wow. We have so hatred and disdain for anyone who disagrees with our beliefs. That doesn't seem like we value ALL people to me. Why don't you protest against companies that knowing hire sexual predators and suspected rapists? Refuse to watch swimming because of the Brock the Rapist? But nope, that's ok because Brock stands for the flag and Colin Kaepernick  doesn't. Good to see your values are in the right place.
Okay, I really wish I could have been there.   (I sadly couldn't, because I am one of the countless LGBTQAP+ people who can't attend events like this because that would mean coming out of the closet to them. And seeing as my family is composed of people who say that they are fine with LGBTQAP+ people, but if they say that they  might be anything other than cis or straight, that that's shoving it in their faces. Such is life...)
The main problem is that not enough people bother to vote - Alaska (and many L48) elections usually get voter turn outs of less than 25%.   Those that vote the most in recent years are the highly motivated anti-women's choice, anti-minority, anti-LGBT, anti-planet protecting, Bible thumping, saber rattling older white folks.   They exercise their voting rights with diligence and their candidates win the elections. Simple as that.  I can understand that many are disgruntled with our voting system, but on the local and state levels, every vote counts! One person =one vote!  If you don't vote, you've surrendered.
"Forget nativity scene"... the globe takes liberties to make that headline!!!  If the Globe posted "Forget Allah ... or Buddha" they would have extreme backlash from those religious groups.  But Christianity just takes what the secular world dishes out.   Canada has to bend over for every religion and LGBT bathroom requirement, but Christianity just gets pushed aside.  Talk of changing the anthem, evolution focused schooling, prayer not allowed by political settings, etc are some of the plethora of paper cuttings that Christianity just accepts.
"Real Women" are actually using their "Christian values" to justify the imprisonment and discrimination of LGBTQ people? And they wonder why their brand of religion gets so much criticism these days. As a gay man, an apology would certainly go a long way toward acknowledging the past wrongs of our society, but it should also be accompanied by greater action to combat homophobia, bullying and ongoing discrimination.   Strengthening the Human Rights Commission and giving it a more expanded authority would be a good first start, as would bringing back the Court Challenges Program that the conservatives shamefully abolished.
What a limited definition for the culture of life:  save fetuses, put LGBTQ back in the closet.  It's unfortunate that this bigly limited definition will allow so many of you to sleep in righteousness as millions lose their health insurance, social safety nets are gutted, babies die from malnutrition, women die in childbirth or from botched abortions, and more vets, the mentally ill, and elderly become homeless and die on the streets.
Since the Globe & Mail didn't have a reporter in Crimea at the time of separation from Ukraine, I wonder who fed them the fodder from which they opined this editorial.
Let us begin by dispensing with the comment "your excluded club", uncivil, combative, and not conducive to discourse.  Jesus' mercy and forgiveness are offered without exception to all.  Receipt of them requires repentance. There is still a Hell and there are still those who will no respond.
I am the judge. I'm not afraid of, nor do espouse or teach the fear of Blacks, Asians, Gays, Native Americans and etc. Maybe I'm practicing moral relativity but you are using false equivalencies and, as a maybe moral relativist, I avoid people that somehow think child molestation and murder is the equivalent of being LGBT.
I think the other error that comes up is in equating the LGBTQ community with hate groups, or other entities or things someone finds immoral or wrong, based on that alone---Not unlike the "arguments" comparing same-sex marriage to sex with animals or child abuse.  The LGBTQ community is not a hate group---They are individuals who happen to have a different sexual or gender orientation than traditional social norms.  Far from being perverse in any way, those LGBTQ folks I've known in my life have, by and large, been some of the more morally and socially conscious people I know, not to mention outstanding parents---Which makes me think this is really a politically motivated thing after all; pandering to personal prejudice for political popularity, to alliterate:  "Religious freedom" is being used as a tool to deny freedom to others, for the political gain of certain religious organizations.
Wait a minute! Minnery's wife works? Well, that's against the Bible. I bet he lets her sleep in the house too when she is menstruating, which is also against the Bible. If his children have ever been disrespectful and disobedient, they must be put to death according to the Bible. Is the suit he was wearing in this photo of mixed fibers? Yup, you guessed it, against the Bible. I wonder, if being an Alaskan, Minnery has ever had crab - shellfish is against the Bible. I find it interesting how people like Minnery pick and choose in order to support their ideology that being LGBT is evil and wrong. His Jesus never once mentioned homosexuality, however he did have a lot to say about other topics. Jesus commanded that His followers take care of the poor, comfort the lonely and downtrodden, feed the hungry, clothe widows and orphans etc. Not one single comment about gay people.
Nice guy - naive too.  Its a shame.  We are losing women, especially young women, to the Nones, and just in general, more than even protestant churches but not one mention that maybe we need to treat and ordain them as equals in this article.    As I reminded a Catholic Friend of mine lately, there is freedom to discuss, on our altars,  the lives of child molesting, gay and transgender murdering, prostitute, priests, with three wives on the side, but I better not suggest God ever called any women to ordained priesthood.    I do believe we need to work something out for LGBT in the form of them having a way to avow to each other fidelity in their relationship before friends and the church. At the present, just having rules enforced by pastors that these families must be treated the same as heterosexual families and welcomed the same would be a huge improvement.  We also need to have bishops who don't allow LGBT teachers to be fired from RC schools.  There is no excuse for this.
The professional image consultants creation, Pope Francis, has indeed fooled many into believing Francis is different from all the rest. He continues to say one thing but do another, continues to show his disdain for women, LGBT and clergy abuse victims, continues to protect complicit bishops, continues in refusal to release documents to prosecutors despite his promises of complete transparency. He continues the secretive self serving actions of an organization that is supposed to be Holy. Holy it is not.
Alaska passed an Anti-Discrimination Act back in the mid 1950s.  Alaska Natives weren't allowed in most white-owned businesses.  That bill sought to end discrimination for not only Alaska Natives, but for anyone living in Alaska.  If you open a business, you're inviting the public (everyone) to patronize your  business.  Therefore, you can't very well draw an invisible line and cherry pick customers.  It's over anti-LGBT supporters.  No religious beliefs or affiliation can stop the US Supreme Court's declaration supporting gay-marriage.  Accept that the LGBT community forever has parity with the heterosexual community.
. THIS IS HORRIBLE .  "Judge sets date for hearing of lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of underage rape"  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-accused-underage-rape-lawsuit-a7352976.html  .  .  The girl was 13 years old at the time trump raped her.  .  .
Yeah, in your disturbed mind only Democrats identify as LGBTQ and have a monopoly on LGBTQ identity. Wow...that is seriously deranged....
The American right wing warriors should be taken with a grain of salt. Cuban exiles have anger and resentment  to last for generations. Rapprochement between United States and Cuba is long over due. Trump threat to tear up the recent agreement highlights the fact that he is a course politician and miles away from being a statesman.  Justin Trudeau has yet to see a international trade agreement that he does not want to sign undemocratically, committing Canada and Canadians. Fresh from lecturing deepest, darkest Africa on the newest liberal agenda, LGBT rights, Trudeau seeks to deepen ties with dictatorships. Opening special access to Trudeau's Liberal government to China's billionaires ought to be ringing alarm bells. China is not really interested in buying more from Canada but are very interested in owning more of Canada, especially formerly off limit sectors. Trudeau position is that it is all good, nothing to see here, is at the very least naïve.  Is Justin Trudeau a real Liberal?
When women wanted the right to vote, millions of women stood up and got it done. When African Americans wanted civil rights, millions of African Americans stood up and got it done. When the LGBT community wanted the right to marry whoever they wanted, millions of LGBT members stood up and got it. Now millions of Americans are tired of the political system we have and are standing up and millions more will join in. Even if Bernie doesn't get the nom. He has started something that won't go away. Change will and can happen when millions of people stand up and speak out! We are not here just for laws passed, we are here to change the face of American Politics. Lastly Bernie is the only non-millionaire or billionaire running for President.
It started that way, but now is used for all LGBTQ who are aboriginal.
Ladies I was on the team that lost the national championship. If I can give you one word of advice that if we followed UAA would've had a national championship with our team. The advice is to not change a thing don't over think it. Do what got you there. Good luck and we're all pulling for you. Paul Schoenborn
One of mine bounced as well. I guess the LGBTQ Mafia is watching closely.
Saying Mr Trump's base "fear African Americans, Muslims, LGBT people in one sentence, and then calling out Republicans for "demonizing the opposition into an art form" is a very interesting form of hypocritical irony.
Is there a quota?  Some affirmative action requirement?  What is it based on?  Percentage of people in Eugene?  Oregon?   Are there important sub-sets like Black-female-bi-sexual?
I skipped the gay marriage issue only because I ran out of characters.  At the present time, our SACRAMENTAL theology of marriage does appear to presuppose a man and a women with a view to procreation. I can conceive of a distant future when that could change.   But this is not the question on the table for Catholics at this time. In terms of today:  1) I utterly reject our current magisterial teaching that homosexuality is an intrinsically disordered state, and that gay sex in immoral, and thus gay marriage as the context for immoral gay sex is, therefore, immoral.   2) I totally support gay marriage as a secular institution, and am totally ashamed of Catholic resistance to governments legalizing gay marriage.  3) Given the above, I would very much like to see secular gay marriages in Catholic churches with the addition of an appropriate blessing.   But VVV, I don't understand why you addressed your questions to me? They do not appear to have arisen out of any particular comment.
The Catholic Church is the only way for those who know it is. Those who don't know this through no fault of their own cannot be held responsible for their ignorance and their ultimate fate is left to God. The Church's attitude towards women is only a problem for feminists. It's attitude towards those whom you call LGBT is as benevolent as it is to all sinners. We have covered this before.
. David Sanguesa, Trump supporter.  Racist,                   ...check. Bigot,                     …check. Homophobe      ….check.     Misogynist            …check. Xenophobe           …check.
Can we not give people at at anti-lgbt hate groups a mouthpiece please? They don't deserve any legitimacy.
I have always thrilled to, loved, worshipped, respected, admired, been inspired by and watched this incredible lady with breathless anticipation.  She is a sort of cosmic glue that I have seen bring the races, the sexes, the sexually liberated, the straight, the gay, the bi, the trans, the drag queens, the smart, the simple, the bright, the quiet, the extroverted ALL together, uniting them in sweat, style, joy and dance, and I have seen her liberate the introverted on occassion too.  Hers is a rare and precious gift.  Posh.  Decadent.  Slummer.  Aristocrat.  She is all things to so many!  Oh!  And she ALWAYS puts a hot little wiggle in my ass!  She can spin me all she likes!
Let's see.  Over 70% of Republicans would rather have Putin as POTUS than Obama.    As one author has pointed out, "Today’s Russia is a place where government officials are corrupt, life expectancy remains stubbornly low, young soldiers are sent to die in wars their government won’t even acknowledge, opposition politicians and critical journalists are murdered or arrested in alarming numbers, LGBTQ people are subject to state-sanctioned violence, and entire regions are run as the personal fiefdoms of despotic warlords."    Of course what Trump supporters don't realize is that Trump has for years been trying to curry favor with Russian oligarchs to develop real estate interests in Russia.  Or they don't care, which is even worse.  65% of Trump supporters believe Obama is a secret Muslim.    So yeah, we can argue about the numbers, but there is no question that many of Trump followers are deplorable.
What I don't understand about those who want to deny service to LGBT people, is why they aren't equally selective about other sinners.
Here's a news flash - the Church is the entire People of God, of which only less than 1% is the hierarchy.  Many/most of the entire People of God have recognized the bigotry and misogyny of thinking of LGBTQ folks as intrinsically disordered;  they have also acknowledged their right to marry the person they love.  In addition, they realize that there are no scriptural, moral, or logical reasons why women cannot receive all of the Seven Sacraments.  These Catholics do not intend to embrace the Protestant faith; they intend to stay in the RCC.  Their goal is to "Keep the faith, change the Church".
The aspects on LGBTQI issues in this document are truly disappointing. But as Fr. Thomas Reese hinted at and as I have read, I would like to see posters also give commentary on other parts of the document that are pretty relevent.  1)The big strides on tackling the sexual abuse issue 2)Pastoral care when it comes to indigenous issues 3)The inclusion of social justice education, particularly on environmental issues as a part of seminary training 4)The implementation of Amoris Laetitia's emphasize on the pastoral aspects of the priesthood.   I know what is being commented on is important. But I notice a tendency here and other places that the only things that people find important here are the Pope's commentary on issues related to Gender politics and sexuality.  These other issues deserve commentary as well, particularly the aspect on indigenous affairs and the environment in light of debates like Standing Rock and I would like to see us broaden our social justice commentary more here.
You may be right, but I think those items are only part of the list.  One could counter in saying that those are also - when inverted - the same issues that drive many Catholics from our doors.  The lack of gospel values in and hateful treatment of LGBT persons, the rules about contraception and marriage and celibacy and the abuse of the laity's money to built elaborate and palatial bishop residences, all have forced a good number to leave us.  So, why is that?  You have it reduced to liberal vs. conservative, and that is simply so insufficient of an explanation for either church it is surprising you would cast it in that light.
The terminology “intrinsically disordered” (objectively is not normally used) signifies that (a) it is inherent in the condition and (b) it is inconsistent with God’s plan, in this case man and woman and procreation.  It is not a moral judgment nor is it hateful. It is a sterile assessment of a particular orientation which makes it clear that acting on it is inconsistent with the moral law. It is also a direct translation from the Latin.  The Church has repeatedly stated that the orientation itself is not immoral and that those who persecute or deny rights to others based on orientation alone are themselves committing a serious sin.  If you can come up with a better phrase, please share it.  One of the reasons it is stated so starkly is to dispel any notion that the Church will change its teaching on LGBT sexual relations, which as you can read any day on this very blog is still hoped for by some few.
I wasn't equating the two at all. I am sorry if that's how it read to you.What I meant is that there are many, many people of all stripes who are hurting and they come to church looking for some peace and serenity. I hate that our church has been, on many occasions, exclusive rather than inclusive. I was only trying to say that if we kept telling people to keep coming back maybe they would find the peace that we all seek. In addition, I do not believe that LGBT people need to "change" in regards to their sexuality. They are as God made them and my God makes no mistakes. I hope that clarifies what I was trying to convey. I truly meant no condensation. BTW, this is why I stopped commenting for a good while.
LGBTQ people have been fired, evicted, beaten, banished, or killed on discovery for the past 1,000 years because of Evangelical / Fundamentalist Christian dogma. I'm glad humanity is starting to evolve past this history. But, it's naïve to expect that it be forgotten or ignored.  If you do not want to be associated with history, then do not associate with those responsible for it.
In this country, we are badly in need of some balance. While we have withdrawn huge areas in the west, and particularly in Alaska for environmental protection, the people of the eastern states live in an overly crowded, environmentally challenged living space. Therefore, I recommend we let the fire burn itself out; the president can then use an executive order withdrawing the area, making it a national monument. A few thousand property owners are little sacrifice for a national policy of protectionism. The greenbelt created will give those living on the eastern seaboard 100 years from now, a breath of fresh air; the ecosystem will have come back into balance:)
I don't believe you ever can sever yourself entirely from your own culture.  It's sort of like the ring in the bathtub, there is always some left.    Cultures are not 'equal or unequal' IMO.  Just different.  That doesn't mean all cultures are acceptable to me, however.  My cultural background does not permit me to accept the tenets of some other cultures, no matter how long they have been around or how many people accept them.   Female castration/mutilation, inequality of females in voting, driving, etc., and most of the rest of Shar'ia law which ensure the ascendency of the Mullahs and males will never be accepted by me, for example.  Polygamy, polyandry, group marriage, bi-sexuality, etc, I see no problem if I am not forced to participate or required to pay for their choices.    Same with partial or complete nudity and other things which vary by culture.  Do as you please  but leave me alone in my choices and don't expect me to support you.
"opponents of gun control regularly argue that the issue is terrorism, or Islam, or mental illness"    Yes it is.    Greg Gutfeld wrote, “How can America defeat ISIS if we have vocal factions believing that we are worse? How can we fight the enemy if a large portion of our population thinks an inanimate object – a gun – caused Orlando?”
Absolutely, MikeAA.    'The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away'!  It was the Vatican who FIRST permitted the Knights of Malta to be established.  The Vatican can revoke their charter to exist in connection with the church.  If the Knights of Malta want to exist as a secular group----running a casino, teaching boating safety, etc.---fine.  But they should not have any chancellor nor a 'spiritual patron' assigned from the Vatican.  I am sure that Chancellor Boeselager's services can be easily utilized in another capacity.  And if the charges against him were totally untrue---Boeselager should, not only pursue but be encouraged to pursue legal action against the Knights because he didn't commit any SIN [crime} and his name was tarnished.   Cardinal Burke, I'm sure, was called into the Vatican to hear his account of this whole action---since he was present.
So everything is permitted in your view?
Oh, please. This incident clearly has nothing to do with LBGT; or citizens of North Carolina; or left (or right) wing nuts; or integrating public restrooms. This is about policing and what we do with mentally ill and dangerous people. Don’t blow your credibility or concern on those issues by rattling off on this creepy incident.
You know, people might actually take you seriously if your moniker was a bit more mature. 420? really? Do you really need proof to understand that humans are quite complex in total, and the assumption that all who identify as something alternate to what you consider the norm is a failure to understand that complexity.   "Ron Boyer believes the election of Hillary Clinton would be a positive signal because she’s a woman (letters, May 21). Our president’s already dictated that a 15-year-old boy who “feels like” a girl must be allowed to use the girls’ restroom and even shower with the girls." ...this contains no logic. There is literally no association between the two sentences. The first is in regard to the gender of the President and the historical precedent that would be altered (similar to the first half-black pres), while the other criticizes the push towards civil rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. Why not complain about LBGTQ folks in lavs? It's an irrelevant issue.
Well I agree with you regarding the products. However, I see big lines every morning in the Scotiaplaza location despite the very close proximity of similar/better stuff. This is why I bought the shares pre-merger and was happy to sell after the announcement.
Actually, Jonah, Hillary is NOT a lifelong feminist.  She does not give a DAMN about any other female save herself, as shown by her own reaction, and actions unto the many females involved within her own husband, and how she went after them.  Hillary is, has always been, and shall always be, Hillaryist, within that the only individual that she seeks to give unto a better life is Hillary.  Female voters?  Don't give a crap about you, but will say anything to get your vote to further mine own career.  Other pigmented voters?  I control you, and you shall vote for me, because it is not that I do not give a crap about you, your families, or your culture, it is mine own lies within a speaking message that I expect you to vote for me, by the way, screw you all.  The LGBT community?  Well, I laugh in your face privately, but will tell you whatever it is you want to hear, just so you shall vote for me, though within the end, no help from me!  ALL of you can kiss my ass!  But vote for me, OK?
"2" is for 2 spirited, used by first nations to represent all variations of LGBTQ.  I suppose they could add a category of men who lie to put peanut butter on there daughters genitalia and watch the dog lick it off, since according to the Supreme Court of Canada earlier this year, this is legal in Canada .  Randy should be a special envoy for this category as well so that they are not needlessly prosecuted.
The LGBT lifestyle isn't for me, but who am I to say it isn't OK. Westboro members should be listed as a terrorist organization. They picket our soldiers funerals - the ones that were killed protecting this great country of ours.  They picked the wrong state to try their BS.   As a joke I was thinking of printing the LGBT Flag with Westboro Baptist Church Supports LGBT on it and passing them out... But I figured APD already has enough on their hands.
And this the only thing LGBT folks want from the church, to be left alone in the public sphere.
I wasn't splitting hairs, T. I was being honest: my comment WAS about employment discrimination, a much more serious matter.  You're just trying to save face.  Even if you took sufficient flight of fancy to feel pleased at that "around 70%" mark of support for Ashers, you must know that it is an utterly risible fraction of the UK population as a whole. Proving my point that any attempt to discriminate here against LGBT people in terms of employment, etc, would not be tolerated. And you know it.  By the way, T., you remember, from school, that particular lesson in British political history? About prime minister Benhamin Disraeli? You remember. The one in which Disraeli declared that there are "lies, damned lies, and statistics". You should, because that is how you chose to present the level of support for Ashers...as a statistic. "Around 70%" support sounds persuasive, doesn't it? A real case-clincher. Until you realise that impressive percentage represents a paltry few thousand.
You state in part:  "4. There must be no discrimination against GLBTQ persons in accessing services of government or business.".  The Catholic Churcch IS a business, yet it constantly fires LBGTQ people.  Sometimes just for being that way, sometimes when word gets out that the people have entered into legal same-sex marriages.  The church needs to protect ALL persons.
From my own experience, when teachers whinge about how many "special needs" students on IEPs they have, take it with a whole cup of salt. School administrations will label almost any kid as "special needs" because they get extra funding for SEAs and the school.  From the outside, you'd think there was an epidemic of children with mental health and disability issues.  In reality, there just isn't. Kid is stubborn and doesn't want to learn to read: special needs.  Kid has crappy parents who don't help with homework: special needs.  Kid is tired a lot because they dont go to sleep when they're told: special needs.  Kid is easily distracted in class: special needs.  You see where I'm going with this. My former stepdaughter was stubborn and wouldn't read, she'd guess from the pictures.  She became "special needs". The school sent her to counselling, told us not to get a tutor, made us wait perpetually for a psych exam, yada yada. I taught the kid to read in a couple months and she now reads
She should sing for the gay and lesbian supporters of Trump  out of 120 million who  voted do you seriously believe there were none?
The Church is not the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is God. The Holy Spirit preserves the Church from teaching error, He does not direct it from above like a puppeteer (although He must be having His work cut out during this papacy).😎 Regarding the Kingdom of God, the latest translations say "it is amongst you" rather than it is "within all of us", a subtle difference there, a translation of 'intra' in the Vulgate. But then you may prefer earlier translations which may seem to support your contention, try the Koine Greek.
I have not seen any nof you standing for God. ISAÍAS 58:1 tells me to unmask sin, you guys do not care but condoning sin.  The thing you are missig here is that The church Is not trying to help gay people. The church is giving them green light to sin, and telling them that their lifestyle Is OK with God. That is not love, that is perversion.  I dare you to read those documents I mentioned. And you know The fruits of those docs? Well, how about a transgender Elder in Hollywood SDA, an openly gay SDA church.   Do not confuse love with sin (Eph. 5:1-77). Did you see what happened in Loma Linda:  "Heterosexuality is an ideal. Homosexuality is the reality because of Romans 3:23"  "Jesus had two fathers", we affirm the LGBT lifestye."  "The bible does not address the LGBT lifestye. Paul knew nothing about our sexual orientation today."  "The Bible cannot be taken literally, especially Leviticus 18:22"  Do you see any sign of help here for LGBT people or do you see perversion?
Amen to that.   If the church is not reaching out to all of God's hurting children, it isn't doing it's job.   The youth, especially,  need the support of their church.  The suicide rate for LGBT teens is scandalous. It's been that way for decades.  Unfortunately the "culture warrior bishops and one issue catholics  think that some lives are more valuable than others.
You are reaching so very far in your attempts to equate alcoholism and LGBT status as being one and the same, you will fall into the chasm of untruth and disinformation as you continue to lose your grip.  You have no basis whatsoever, except for prejudice beyond description, for posing such a view.  All that we have leaned in some 60 years of close study says you are wrong.  For one who so loudly and repeatedly bleats a mantra of knowing truth, it is somewhat surprising that you do not pursue it in a widening view of our shared humanity.
When did I say that I went to church? Oh that's you putting words in my mouth. Not surprising from a Hillary supporter. I guess having common sense about crooked Hillary, makes you think that I drank "the kool aid" lol. Can you explain to me how she's not in jail? Private email server, deleting 33k emails after FBI told her to hand them over, excepting a pricey gift as secretary of state, getting money donated to her foundation from foreign governments, some that will lock a woman up for adultery, if she gets raped, but you don't see any crime in what she did, but you're judging me? Good one. You have no common sense to do so!
Before Beth thinks about jumping parties she needs to realize that everything she thinks about Trump a majority of the LGBT community thinks about the entire GOP. Until she comes to that realization she should just hang out with her buddies in the party of Trump, Cruz, Christie, Rubio, Cheney, Carson, etc... (Who all believe the same thing about women - it is just that Trump is the loudest misogynistic bigot in the clown car...)
I agree, Elagabalus.  It's clearly a vendetta against gays.  And I consider the firings to be very violent acts.   I find this entire thing to be very upsetting.  Talking about being against violence is not the same as stating clearly that LGBTQ people are God's children and no different from those who are heterosexual, created by God to be as they are, and stating clearly that homosexual expressions of love are no different from heterosexual expressions of love.
I would like to continue this discussion, but your hiding being "SkeptiCat", I've heard all the reason people wish not to use their real names.  Oh check letters to the editior and I show up there now and again, same name I use here.  Stand behind your real name, means more, it is to easy to say things and never have it come back to you personally.  Have a Good Day, the snow is melting finally, each to his own view. Good Day to who ever you are he/she and to be Political Correct LGBT, this is not disrespect but respectful of today's world.
You're describing every friend I have had over the past 70 years, and very close to describing me, although I'm hanging on by short and ragged fingernails.  We all made it through (joyfully) the transition post-Vatican II and reared our families in active faith, but the hypocrisies and ugly underbellies of clericalism following the child sexual abuse, along with the institutional Church's positions regarding LGBT people, misogyny re women's ordination and the reactionary reigns of both JPII and BXVI did us all in.  None of our children have remained Catholic, although we all sacrificed to provide Catholic educations for them.  I no longer feel I have abandoned the RCC but that it has abandoned all of us in its self-worship of the institution.  It is 500 years out of date intellectually, especially in light of science and human science information.
Yea thats a real big deal there sunny! Not
There would be no need for a "two way bridge" if the Catholic Church had not dug a Grand Canyon sized,  artificial,  and scientifically invalid chasm between it and LGBT people and then started filling it in with their mutilated and burned bodies in the Inquisitions.
The decision was based on a violation of Equal Protection Clause of the Alaska Constitution-- the idea that similarly situated individuals will be treated equally by the law-- not on privacy rights. In this case,, the "similarly situated individuals" are pregnant minors.   The failure of the Parental Notification Law begins with Mr. Minnery, Lt. Gov Leman and Alaska Family Action. In their single-minded zeal they crafted a voter initiative whose language and provisions failed to meet the simplest of standards for civil liberty in our Constitution--Equal Protection Under the Law. Those who live in Anchorage and have been witness to his efforts to promote discrimination against LGBTQ Alaskans will not be surprised at Minnery and Leman's inability to negotiate the concept of Equal Protection.The civil protections afforded by our Constitution cannot be treated as trivialities to be glossed over-- no matter what the goal.    I vote "yes" on Justices Bolger and Maassen.
I was standing next to Preston as this was happening, I have never seen so much hatred in one day. They said I'm going to hell because I support the LGBT community. Part of being Christian is acceptance and I saw none of that towards the two people from the Baptist church today.
Ricks friend is already a she wether she has had GRS or not, she is already a woman wether her drivers license has an F on it or not. Sure these documents are necessary for navigating certain parts of society but shouldn't be a prerequisite for going pee. Also many states don't require GRS to change your vital documents, these procedures are expensive as most insurance won't pay for them yet, carry risks, and are not necessary for trans people without genital dysphoria. There is no surgical requirement to change your state of Alaska Drivers License gender marker or your Social Security and US Passport gender marker. In the next decade you will find that states have moved away from a surgical requirement for Birth Certificates too.
I'm sure it's Satanism.
While I understand your reaction to Elder's analogy (we certainly do have our reactions to the KKK, or Hitler, when they're used to extend a point), I do think it is fair to ask the basic question:  If Jules church's official policy toward women is misogynistic (they are "not fit" to lead), or toward the LGBT community is homophobic (the only permissible union is between a man and a woman), then what is the responsibility of the churches' members who disagree with that policy? I appreciate that Jules' faith "is a really big motivator for what I do."  And I appreciate how he has stood up for the LGBT community in the Legislatore (per an email I just received from my Rep, Rob Nosse, who replaced Jules).  What I can't resolve, in my own mind, is Jules tacit support for a church that strongly disagrees with his apparent stands. That said, as one whose loving wife constantly points out his own inconsistencies, I can relate.
the moslems invaded israel and built their sign of conquer on what they believed to be the temple mount. that land of israel was given to abraham, isaac, and jacob. the book is not a trilogy- the Lamb of God is the beginning and the end. you call the God of the Jews and Christians 'ha-satan'? yet you claim to be  the final chapter? so interesting.
You should wash your hands after "liking" yourself, Roy...
Thank you for your clear, persuasive discussion.  I hadn't known that Jesus said anything about mercy vs. sacrifice.    A question for you:  What does Jesus say about mercy vs. justice in this world.  I know that in the next world, we won't stand a chance if Jesus is pure justice.  We'll all be in a beggar's posture.  But tell me how you think that equation works out in THIS life.  The question is important to me, because I was a career prosecutor (now retired) always seeking to secure justice while also trying to extend mercy.  I was rarely satisfied that I got it right.  I'd like to know what you think.
Just last week there was a article in the paper back east  about a lesbian that killed her bull dyke partner, because she was cheating with another lesbian-THE KIND SANCTIONED BY YOUR BELIEFS............tou·ché
Apparently, you are the one who needs to read some of those verses instead of just doing a search the only verse that discusses man and woman is MT 19:3-5. You say I pass on lies, however, that is your interpretation of the Bible, not mine. How do you know you are right and I am wrong? The other verses discuss fornication or sex outside of marriage still being a sin. MT19:3-5 does say male and female, but does not say there are no other options. Keep in mind that the New Testament does not take back the ban on shellfish, marrying a non-virgin, or mixing cloths to wear nor eating pork. It also gets into adultery and pre-marital sex and being drunk. So, if you are doing any of those, I guess you are just as guilty as a sinner as you imagine a person who is homosexual might be. Obviously, I don't believe they are guilty of  any sin. However, you seem to have forgotten Gal 5:14.
Especially those that are lesbian phobic and dead from the neck up.
How can it be that your only comment about this tragedy is a snarky quip about guns?
Hardly paranoid; many Globe comments are racist/bigoted.  The Globe seems to have taken a step backward with the new Civil Comments system.  And of course the National Post focuses on jewish donors.  I wondered why you did.  Ditto for his racial makeup.
Girl, you are soooo blind.
Will end up with a disabled lesbian trans-gendered immigrant youth at risk who knew someone that lived close to store that sold an astronomy book once.
Thinking back about Trump's rise to power and eventual President elect... one thing really amazes me. How much Ivana Trump must have got paid to keep her mouth shut.
Schlameel, Schlmogle, Hops & Tops Incorporated.  No matter.  The EPA has exceeded it legal bounds not just here but everywhere.  This man went into hiding and undercover agents finally found him.  That is a simple fact,
https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.405  Sodomy: anal or oral copulation In my legal background: 1(d) "or physical helplessness" does not belong whatsoever on this statute, and allows for far too broad of a scope of interpretation (or abuse by prosecutors as most every law on the ORS is designed to facilitate)  "deviant" sexual intercourse in this County/Oregon covers everything most everyone has either done or witnessed at some point, yes, even grandma; and EVERYONE in the LGBT community.  He said it was consensual she changes her mind after copulation, and says it was not   too bad, you're a man - thus, you have no viable defense, so you lose.  lesson for 2017 - don't shag with any woman who has even a drop to drink or is on any medication, recreational or prescribed,  ...Which whittles down all male's prospects too = "0" ZERO chance of meeting an Amish girl in a bar.
The measure DOES NOT protect LGBT.  "The failed amendment would have effectively nullified a provision in the defense authorization that the House passed late Wednesday night. The language embedded in the defense bill states that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts can't be discriminated against on the basis of religion."
Their a lot of people who are very angry of the injustice that maybe coming from Trumps cabinet picks. He will try to distract the people by outrageous tweets and by the games he plays, but people are starting to stand up more then ever. We have much too lose. For example, how the world view the US. If we pull out of the Paris Accord we are telling the world that our treaty's to other countries means nothing to us anymore. Same thing goes with NATO and other countries we Militarily support. For example S Korea would be invaded by N Korea and that could destabilize the world economy. I think this time things will different then other President's because if Trump goes along with those around him, he will be making the following very angry - Blacks, Muslims, Native American, LGBT community, Public school teachers, women, immigrants, the elderly, the disable, middle class, poor and I sure I missed a few groups. But you get the point.
Agreed, except that there have been two issues among the Catholic hierarchy of late, not one: abortion AND same-sex marriage, or anything else that advances the lives of LGTB people. Those are the same two issues about which Pope Francis said we need to stop "obsessing."
Tell that to the people who currently live in those states who do not feel very protected.   Other countries are issuing warnings to their LGBTQ travellers about going to those states and/or being openly affectionate with their loved ones. This is not a joke. The states are acting lawlessly for sure but that is the powder keg we live in. People are going to get hurt.
Let's get this straight.  You are all but stating that the ADN is not reliable in relaying the facts in this instance?  That we cannot go to the relevant FB page and see the exact same thing as noted by the ADN?  Let's take a quick spin to the show's FB page (which conveniently enough is cited by the article) which shows an image titled "Islamist Compounds in the U.S." and identifies the relevant party as "a candidate pops up in the last Alaska election, who is a member of this group[.]"  Now let's compare it to the article's assertion.  "Demboski posted a link to a blog about "Islamic compounds" across the United States that were supposedly "stockpiling weapons" . . . Without identifying Jones by name, Demboski wrote that the group responsible for the "compounds" had a member in Alaska, and that he had run for political office.  Your criticism of "all us folks" seems entirely valid and shocking given how unreliable and inaccurate the ADN was.
I don't care about a politician's sexual orientation unless it affects their political agenda in some fashion which affects me.    Governor Brown could be having group sex during  LGBT meetings every week and I still would want to know why she hasn't implemented the governmental transparency and improved ethics she promised when she was appointed to replace Kitzhaber instead of the media focusing on her 'strength' or her 'fears'.  But the media likes controversy; it sells.
The Platform has always been pie in the sky for both parties - I'm curious to see if the Dems manage to excise God from theirs this time, as they very nearly did last time.  I think Peter Thiel was allowed that speech to soften the Republicans' reputation for homophobia.   Frankly, I use and enjoy PayPal - it was a brilliant idea (and had better support under Meg Whitman).  Look - personally, I'm a cranky old straight right-wing septuagenarian retired network engineer Vietnam era veteran who grew up in pre-civil rights Texas, and, to me, most of these LGBTQ people are confused at best - but I still believe they have a right to live according to their best lights - that's the Constitution - as long as their rights don't interfere with other folks' rights (as has happened some lately).   So, while I don't personally approve of the LGBTQ lifestyle,  I applaud Trump for opening the dialog - whether it's in the platform or not.  The Dems can't have an honest conversation about ANYTHING.
Dave - if the 13 year old were gay or bisexual, Avakian would have imposed a big fine like the cake or the karaoke bar back when they filed the criminal case. I think avakians bias is already clear.
There has always been clear rules before. Born a girl compete with girls. Now we are making stuff up that is in natural. What a messed up world this has become.
The Evangelical powers-that-be who endorse Mr. Trump - especially as being "pro-life" - have made themselves out to be quite blind and foolish in grasping at straws to endorse someone, anyone, other than Sen. Clinton.  It does not speak well for our evangelical brothers and sisters that they would ignore what this man is and does and would do.  Shame on them.  All the more reason that religions should stay OUT of politics.
HI:"Mali means sharp-ended UN peacekeeping. It operates alongside a French-led counterterrorism mission fighting insurgents in northern Mali and across the Sahel-Sahara region. "  THERE IS NO PEACE TO KEEP!!! There are going to be body bags with Canadians in them as a result of this political grandstanding.
Yeah,  since Benedict's 2005 rule, I'm sure ss-attracted men have stopped applying to seminaries.    Just joking.  If you were ss-attracted (or generally confused about your orientation) and wanted to be a priest, how would you be likely to interpret the "deep seated" qualification?     I would bet you'd interpret it as loophole, and still believe yourself not disqualified from a priestly vocation.  Why do I think so?  I think so because Benedict's new rule isn't new at all.   The church has always been "legally" against accepting "gay" men as priests.  And yet studies have confirmed that thousands of priests are gay men.
And prior to 1967, many states (maybe most of them?) required that persons who wished to marry be of the same race.  The racism of the miscegenation laws is no longer 'respectable'; the bigotry which heretofore prevented gay persons from exercising the civil right to marriage enjoyed by other citizens is now recognized, in law and by most people, as no more 'respectable' than the racism of the laws that prohibited interracial marriage.  As an American, a Christian, and a Catholic, I am delighted that the civil rights of our sisters and brothers in the GLBT communities have been affirmed by the Court.
Let's see. Self-styled peacemakers like Pandora wish for the opposition to forget everything the president-elect and his alt-right legions ever said and did and make nice with:  racists Nazis and other anti-Semites misogynists anti-LGBT bigots xenophobes Islamophobes neo-fascists theocrats isolationists climate-change denialists anti-American Russian sympathizers anti-American guerilla poseurs anti-Christian Christian tribalists post-truth ignoramuses  Hell no.
Isn't there a stronger word than "naive" to describe this man. I can think of a couple but the post would probably get deleted.  He sure has some sort of myopic view on things that's for sure.
The LGBT need a safe environment in the church to come to grips with who they are and what the church teaches. Dignity USA is an such an organization of gay catholics. Persecuted by "St." JP2 and Benedict they continue to survive and minister to those wounded by the hierarchy of the church. Fr. Martin means well but the ball is in the clergy's court. As soon as the clergy ends the sniping of the LGBT, they will regain the respect. The LGBT are extremely sensitive to respecting others ...
You can choose to defend your self.  I don't see how that is offensive.  I heard that there were some LGBT in attendance for the very purpose of learning more about this.  Every American has the RIGHT to armed self defense.  Don't be a bigot.  Anti gun is Anti self defense is Anti Gay rights.
Where in the New Testament are followers of Jesus told to take physical violence against anyone for any reason? Christ did command "turn the other cheek ... go the second mile ... love your enemies," did He not? Why do those who are zealous for following the Bible so often ignore Bible teachings? In the end are they following Scripture or their own, sinful ideas?
Here is fine example of an 'UN"civil comment. I knew this "civil comments" proposal was a one way free speech experiment by the RG.   JoshuaWelch "Let’s get something clear about Scalia. Our politics are a direct reflection of our moral beliefs. He was understandably a conservative hero. He was a champion of bigotry, blocking progress for non-heterosexuals at every turn. He also blocked environmental protection every chance he got. He had nine children, which is selfish and irresponsible……he was probably opposed to birth control. And one of his favorite activities was killing defenseless animals for fun. He was a terrible person. This world and our Supreme Court is much better off without him".
After the massacre in Orlando, Trump was literally the only politician to identify the killer as an Islamic terrorist. But Trump was immediate denounced by leaders of the LGBT communities of America and Canada as Islamophobic and homophobic, even when he said he would pledge national security to protect the  lives of all LGBT.  They supported Hillary despite her soft attitude toward the Islam that killed them.
"The Premier said that fixing this problem will be the next major file she tackles. With the items on her agenda largely in motion – building infrastructure, bringing in a cap-and-trade system to drive down carbon emissions, increasing pension benefits and wrestling down the deficit – Ms. Wynne said two major education-related policies will form the core of her re-election bid in 2018.  The first will be creating 100,000 more child-care spaces over five years, in a move to make it easier for parents to join the work force." *** At this point, the reporter must asked the Premier if she could honestly state this with a straight face. I admire his fortitude for not breaking in uncontrolled laughter leaving him struggling for breath.  I have never read an interview of a leader so divorced from reality.  She even made a deflection about Trump. Does one still wonder why Ontario has one of the highest tax rates in the western world?
Fallacy no. 1 "The contemporary humanities (and social sciences) are focused on sexuality, gender and race--not class." To the extent critiques in the humanities are focused on sexuality, gender and race they cannot avoid questions of class. Homelessness, for example, disproportionately affects non-heterosexual youth--"20% of homeless youth are LGBT. In comparison, the general youth population is only 10% LGBT." http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/lgbtq.html Among industrial nations, the US has the largest number of homeless women and the highest number on record since the Great Depression.  http://www.air.org/center/national-center-family-homelessness Commenter 50384 uses politically correct lingo like "confirmation bias" and "echo-chambering" but can't seem to figure out why so many uneducated white voters voted for Trump. The answer  is simple: destroying things is easier and takes less mental effort than creating them so that's what the ignorant did--to their own detriment.
Indeed Jesus never discriminated against anyone.  You are presuming that not ordaining women is discrimination.  When it comes to the gifts and Graces of God, no one can claim a right to them.  No one has the right to ordination.  No one has the right to an office in the Church.  God calls whom He desires.  God is under no obligation to call women to Holy Orders.
Nick- we'll make a deal with her: we won't do anything with her ovaries (trust me), and she'll keep her ovaries out of our wallets. Deal?
Stop with "Trump's win bolstered right backlash". This popular narrative has it completely backward   Hilary lost the election more than Trump won. The silent majority of normal people are tired and angry by leftist extremism, thought tyranny, and bullying. Obviously for Trump to win, this sentiment started before his election (duh), and Trump was the only outlet this discontent had. Hyper examining him as a man to interpret his win is misguided. He was the only choice against leftists so normal people held their noses. What if Trump weren't so bad? Hilary would have lost so badly the Democrats would be wiped out  Pundits completely miss how unhappy the center is with PC craziness that demonizes anyone not a victim of something. Now its hip to be identified as oppressed and thus free to be rude and aggressive with impunity to anyone white. Even the "victims" are infighting about who is a more oppressed victim - with gay women bad mouthing women. Some group claiming it worse than LGBT
Pffft, I've no desire to share any space with people like that. They need to get run out of town along with the rest of the bullying gun nuts.  Two years ago I had a guy follow me to my house all road rage-y over something or other. He had gun stickers all over his car. If we lived in the world he wants, I could have just shot him because I did indeed feel threatened. And that's the world people like that, and this dog killer, really want. Running them out of town with a heavy dose of shunning is the very least they deserve. You really want trigger happy crazies living next to you? Your family could be next, after all.
The Story about the LGBT photographer has had all the comments removed. Strange they even removed the non negative ones.
The one thing DEMS had in common is they didn't care THEIR candidate was a lying career criminal with obligations to countries that murder gays and Christians AND treat their women worse than their dogs... Guess that tells us a LOT about the LEFT and THEIR lack of values.
Where has the Catholic Church NOT stood up against violence against anyo e including the LGBTQRST?
And there's the crux of the argument---You view tolerance of homosexuals as a violation of your religious principles, and public acceptance of the LGBTQ community as infringement on your "religious liberty" (to discriminate against them).  ms. amylou, I'm not concerned that "the parts don’t fit", or anything else that goes on in the bedrooms of consenting adults---It's not my business and it shouldn't be yours either.  You're not being asked to have sex with them, and you're definitely not being asked to help them with that---Only to treat them as equals based on the fact that they are fellow human beings.  "Christians" are hardly people to lecture anyone about what is "normal"---From "speaking in tongues" to drinking snake poison, "faith healing,"  "prosperity gospel," air-conditioned dog houses, and all the rest of the televangelist circus; "christians" don't really come off as authorities on normality, nor are they famous for sticking by their own gospels, especially about money.
So you have programmes for the parents of LGBT children. How admirable! The question is, do you have programmes for the LGBT children? For the LGBT youth, adults, golden oldies? And if not, why not.  As a gay Catholic, the one thing that tires me about the "church" above all else is that it talks about us (LGBT folk), but never, ever talks with us! Chaput at the world meeting of families displayed this disordered tendency ever so well! And the san diego synod does the same ... as John Hobson has pointed out, the criteria for lay participation are claustrophobic: "To assure the validity of their contribution for the good of the Church, it is important that the lay faithful taking part in the Synod should be chosen from amongst those distinguished by their 'firm faith, good morals and prudence'. It is an indispensable requisite that these members of the lay faithful be in a canonically regular situation in order to take part in the Synod."
Fact is the F-35 is part of an information network supplying the arm forces with intelligence and strike capability. No other aircraft is as advanced in this respect.   However this also makes it more complicated.
I've often wondered who chose the order of letters in LGBTQ, etc.   Why do the poor Qs get stuck on the tag end while the high-falutin' Ls are out in front?
Or to control and define conduct for any other minority.   LGBT, for example, are a minority; the values of the majority should be able to control their conduct.  Athiests and agnostics are minorities and should be controlled by the overwhelming majority of those who have a religious faith and the values of those religious faiths..
A savvy presence on social media and a "truly welcoming invitation" MAY get a young person's foot in the door, but the harsh realities of the institutional Church's policies and praxis on the LGBTQ community, the foundational misogyny and patriarchy, the willful ignorance of family planning freedom and the medieval structures still in place will not keep these well-informed and open-hearted/minded individuals long, IMO.  (I happen to have five of these charmers in my family and know many of their friends as well.)
Yet again you leave the question open. What of my comments would be considered in any way racist, anti-semitic, or homophobic?
Not like Wynne who still blames Mike Harris for the state of education in Ontario. Or Justin who still blames Harper for  Ottawa's health care  problems with the provinces. Or Tory who still blames Rob Ford for the state of transit in Toronto, Or Wynne again who still blames Harper for  gender issues in the LGBT community.
Over the last 30 years, LGBTQ Oregonians have been repeatedly attacked by Evangelical Christians (1992's Ballot Measure 9, and on, and on ... ). Yet, Bailey chooses to spend his Sundays with Evangelical Christians, who continue teaching - albeit now with hip music, tattoos, and lattes - that women must submit to men, and that LGBTQ people are inherently sinful.  Doing one thing while saying another on the topic of basic human equality is tolerable - in a First Amendment sense - among private citizens. But, not in someone seeking to lead Portland, Oregon, as our Mayor. Bailey should either admit he believes the Evangelical Christian theology of his church, or join one of the many which treat women and LGBTQ people as equals with straight men, if that's what he actually believes.
I am not arguing that  humans have children---male and female.  I am arguing that the Book of Creation is not the LAST word on understanding all the marvels of Creation.  God DID create humans to do more than procreate as animals do.  Humans mate for companionship as well---even when the concept of bearing a child are no longer possible.   Senior citizens who marry for companionship is an example of this.  But God also created people who choose companionship over procreating children [we no longer need children to contribute to the economy of the family---child-labor].  People who belong to the LGBT community also seek companionship.  They should not be treated like lepers, by the official church.
I just wish the LGBT community would stop pushing the issue.  Why can't they just leave it alone.  It's like they are pushing just to be pushing, not that it really matters to them.  I'm referring to being married by a minister, having cakes baked, wedding planning, etc.  Citizens of the U.S. have been fined money and taken to court because they refused to bake a wedding cake.  The business was more than willing to bake cookies just not anything that was do to with wedding a same sex marriage.  Can't we just all get along?  Maybe if more people would practice the Law of Reciprocity life might be a lot better on earth!  Hmmmm.  Maybe I'm not talking anymore about the subject at hand!
I think the only 'gift of time' the LGBTQ community should give a cleric would be for the purpose of coming out of the closet and to their congregations.
A bigger concern: With Sessions this new administration sounds like "Big Government Conservatism" with lots of people and lots of resources used to control our behavior if possible-- not just marijuana, but also look for a rollback on women's  freedom of choice, LBGT rights (as gay marriage), more police and private prison guards to "crack down on crime"and then the huge increase in border guards -- plus a big  military increase.......all paid for by a cut in taxes......
Thank you for this, Marilyn.  Your letter speaks to the concerns and anxieties which have been heavy on our hearts throughout this campaign but especially so since the election.  As a LGBTQ family who feels among those targeted by the rhetoric of Trump, it means so much to hear these words of support and encouragement from our local community.  May you and your family stay safe and continue to carry the light and hope forward.
Karan ... You did not specifically use the term "LGBT Agenda", but your words hint that you might have this in mind. Isn't it fair to also speak of "the heterosexual agenda"? People and societies often make decisions based upon their "implicit assumptions" - that is, personally unchallenged beliefs (such as that white people are superior, or that the US is the best/greatest, or that heterosexuals are biologically and morally superior). These assumptions are often shown to have many flaws.  You asked, "How much else are  THEY [my emphasis] going to push for?" I would ask, "What are YOU pushing for?" It appears that you are pushing for limitations on them. Why not "Live-and-let-live"? Let's have fair wages, fair housing, fair wedding cakes, fair justice, fair respect for others, etc. The future is a never-ending battle as people with differences counter-punch. How nice it would be if the differing sides tried to understand (rather than condemn) the other.
His parents should never been allowed in America in the first place. Have you seen his fathers video postings??? If you believe they have American values, your delusional on multiple levels. So do you support their views on the LGBT  community?? They demonstrated their beliefs... Keep defending them.
Hawker was the authorized state rep. Legally he bound the state. Don't like it? Vote them out. Once again the socialist AK public wants to be held unaccountable and stick it to industry.
I wonder if they had real text books at Liberty Baptist. Or was the curriculum just about crucifixion? I mean the earth is only 6,000 yrs old right Pete?
Proof it's not the LGBT community you have to worry about in the bathroom, it's hypocritical republicans in the locker room.  "As a federal legislator, Hastert voted regularly against bills to empower gay people. In Congress from 1997 to 2007, Hastert voted for the so-called “Marriage Protection Act,” and in favor of a constitutional amendment to “establish that marriage shall consist of one man and one woman.” The year he stepped down, Hastert voted no on the “Employment Non-Discrimination Act,” a bill to prohibit companies from discriminating against employees “on the basis of sexual orientation.”  Rawstory 5/29/15
Jay - Your assumption is that there is only one way to be Catholic.  I am saying that Catholics come in many different varieties.  Some, like you, stick with the absolute belief in the "2000 years of Catholic Tradition."  That is fine with me for you to believe in that way.    But there are millions of Catholics who do not accept it all.  They, too, are Catholic.  I do not want to "divide" the Church.  You find strength in your faith your way - that is wonderful.  Others find strength in their faith in different ways - and that is what does not appear okay with you.   It is not either/or.  It is both/and.  Either/or sees others as those who "embrace novelties", such as believing that contraceptives are a blessing in the modern world, that LGBT marriage is an important civil right, that women voting, being educated, having careers is wonderful, that traditions evolve in the face of new knowledge and changes in the world.  Either/or divides.  Both/and unites.
Spent 7 years in Winnipeg. Lived in one of the nice neighbourhoods but most of the city is a filthy mess.
I hate to publically reveal my ignorance and spiritual ennui, but I'm not in the least concerned about unity with Lutheranism nor the Orthodox expression of Christianity -- in light of the disunity and schismatic state of Roman Catholicism.  The RCC has lost MILLIONS of members over the past 50 years as it has struggled with the disappearance of fear as reason to follow faithfully, the horror wrought by child sexual abuse and evils of rampant clericalism, the continuation of gross misogyny, and unchristian actions against LGBT brothers and sisters, plus remaining at least 500 years out of date in the realms of science and human development.  Those reforms would be much more meaningful to many remaining Catholics than would ecumenism -- which should be a given since we all (pretend to) follow Jesus anyway.  Maybe we should put our own house in order before seeking to extend power and control over others' particular religious practices?
The Torys of England proved, once again, the failure of their ideological policies degenerating into racism and increased fascism throughout the nation.  Those left behind in the Tory deregulatory disaster are brainwashed into believing the problems are all caused by those nasty immigrants too brown or black in visage to be worthy of British citizenship.  Concurrent with our own national Torys(Republicans) whose descent into courting and appeasing the racists, fundamentalist christians, and corporate monopolists results in the nomination of a racist demagogue.  Corporate media stampedes the ignorant and stupid TV/Video generation into acquiecence for millions of dollars in ad revenue.  The American Demagogue's vitriol leads the headlines to cement his status as the Tory/Conservative ideal.
He created us for him.  When we die, we either die eternally or are claimed by him eternally. Our bodies, souls and minds were given, but can be taken away.  The universe was made and is sustained by his word, and it will end by his word.   The gifts of our lives are not something temporal, God continuously gives us existence. Jesus the living word will return to judge those who will keep those gifts and those who will have them taken away.   If we were true masters of our body we would live forever, never taste heaven, hell or purgatory. God allows us to cooperate with his divine will or reject it, but everything is still by his will.  This is at least what I have gathered after reading Peter Kreeft on Aquinas and listening to Dr. David Anders.
I meant Castro v. King of Saudi Arabia with the Pet Dictator comment.
That certainly is what that bible verse says. What does it have to do with Mayor Berkowitz's Herculean efforts to make sure that more of the money I earn gets to the upstanding bums profiled in this story? I wouldn't want them to be deprived of their intoxicant of choice.
I'm showing in this art show. It's not really about creating a safe space or anything as political as that. I'm gay and I like drawing dudes. I'm allowed right?
Re: Gender identity and discrimination. Basically I agree with Thomas Morse that some religions aggravate discrimination and it is wrong to do so. However, I would raise an issue regarding the clarity of how it is determined that "you is or you aint" in any given category. As with cataloguing any trait (religious belief, interest in fishing, or even sexual identification) characteristics are seldom YES or NO. Rather, reality presents a wide continuum of incremental differences - which might even change over time for one individual.  Apparatus at birth can be misleading. Shifts in sexual orientation might possibly be genetic, hormonal, medical, or even arising from educational or philosophical changes. Perhaps there are actually lesser or greater variations of bi-sexuality which permeate all human beings, but which are currently not measured. Humans travel the world and have extensive genetic mixing - as different from the more closed populations of other animals. (continued next post)
misogyny: "dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women."  homophobia: "dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people."  These definitions come not from "the PC set" but from the dictionary, available to any and all. And yes, the magisterium of the Catholic Church systematizes both.
I refuse to respond to them. How influential we must be that they see us as some kind of threat to their orthodoxy. Heck, I'm not even Catholic anymore and, apparently, I'm still a threat. I think the main point is, as Neko pointed out,  that we support LGBT rights and marriage equality in the secular sphere.
Re: "a Francis set of priorities " 1. After creating 4 commissions to study his finances, his first "reform" of the curia was establishing a Secretariat for (his) Economy. Not once has he suggested that the Vatican, dioceses or religious orders divest themselves of their assets "for the poor." 2. No mercy or compassion for women's lives, health or human rights for LGBTQI persons. 3. After rigging the second Synod of Bishops with his own intrumentum laboris, he again ignored the votes of the bishops re: communion for the divorced, remarried. 4. No appointments or promotions to positions of power for the laity except Fox News, Opus Dei Greg Burke, head of his Press Office. 5. He formed an alliance with Putin ("Did the Pope Just Kiss Putin's Ring"), an accommodation with Castro (wouldn't meet or mention dissenters), and capitulated to Xi Jinping that China will select the candidates for bishops and the pope chooses one. See the IOR’s investments in fossil fuel companies. (lastampa.it)
So true! Parenting is a full time job and while I've never had children, I still hate to hear a stay at home parent say that they do not work. They do the most important job!
I've lived all my life in Oregon, but I've always believed our #1 problem was the entitlement mentality that has developed, fostered by the unions and our criminal governors Goldschmidt and Kitzhaber, now with a boost from bisexual Brown. And you are a self-righteous egoist, testifying in court, writing a book, and being a guest for a program aren't that impressive.
Spare me the lectures on accuracy and spin. You haven't a leg to stand on, Pandora.  I deny the bishops have foregrounded social teaching and the environment as determining factors in political contests. Follow the money: where have the bishops lavished resources? Fighting against LGBT equality and abortion. Oh, and lawyering up to contend with victims of clerical sex abuse.

Obama deported more illegals tha any other President, and created more jobs than Trump can. Even real wages are rising. Hard to justify your spiralling downwards description considering the pile of smelly he inherited.  Neither Obama nor Trump can stop China, India, or any of the others spiralling upwards - and that's the issue. When ½ the world's population decide they have had enough of being poor, there is nothing the US President can do about it.
Tell us all about what you're personally doing to a) help the mentally ill and b) clean up the public spaces the homeless trash so egregiously, and I might take your complaint seriously.
So what do we do with those among us who are unlucky enough to be born with physical, mental or intellectual disabilities and cannot "make your own money?"  Or those of us who become disabled and cannot go back to work or afford the medical bills? Or children orphaned before they are old enough to support themselves but relatives cannot afford to take them in?  Let them starve or freeze to death or beg on the streets?  Sometimes a lack of personal responsibility is not the problem.

Oh man, there are not enough words to describe how much I love this. People can downplay the results of the election as much as they want, complain that Hillary's supporters are "whiners" (conveniently ignoring those burning Obama effigies in 2008/2012), and pretend life isn't going to change for thousands just because their own lives aren't changing. I, for one, am terrified for my health as a woman, the welfare of my LGBTQ+ friends and loved ones, as well as my friends of color that, despite being born in America, will likely have to PROVE that fact. It's despicable. And America let it happen. But by all means, let me just "get over it".
However, when it comes to our LGBT brothers and sisters, love of neighbor seems to be sadly lacking in the institutional Church.
No, I mean that in a positive way. You don't get to be competent in the outdoors by reading magazines. You have to get out there and do it.
LOL, I actually followed you links thinking maybe you provided something from an actual medical or athletic source but nope, I find Joe Rogan and some internet random posting to youtube. Do you generally take your medical advice from uneducated random strangers on the internet or do you talk to you doctor? Here is a link to a page with information from dozens of athletic organizations and their medical bodies made up of hundreds of actual doctors and sports physiologists. They say that transgender athletes who are on HRT for a sufficient period of time retain no undue advantage due to muscle mass or density, red blood cell count, or lung capacity etc.  http://www.transathlete.com/#!policies-by-organization/c1vyj  Who am I supposed to trust on this one, Joe Rogan and internet strangers or doctors?
Lena Ibrahim posted;" There are gay bars an clubs in major " Muslim cities" like Amman, Dubai, Beirut, Istanbul, none of which have seen massacre of this sort.

Monte Sahlin 1 day ago: "Why do we have education for pastoral ministry if God prefers to work with the uneducated? Was God absent from all the voted decisions, all the planning and work that went into these programs and institutions?"  An assumption that attending seminary produces well-educated pastors.  Surely, we have all heard those preachers who may have all the doctrines and proof texts memorized, but outside theological questions are woefully unprepared, even ignorant. If a difficult question is asked on science as it seems to contradict the Bible, does anyone expect and honest answer or evasiveness?  The topics that most today and uppermost are not how the 2300 days were computed but how  should we address the "odd" people in our community, even the church:  gays, LBGT, unmarried couples with children,  single parents with children, separating and divorcing parents and their children, and many similar ones.  Does the seminary give answers to students?
The LGBT agenda did not "magically percolate.... into culture consciousness".  It was extremely well-funded, supported by Hollywood and the media, and carefully planned, including the "linkage" to the civil rights movement.  The last time we saw that sort of thing in this country was not the civil right movement but Prohibition.
The GOP goons would have Swiftboated Bernie just as badly if not worse than the character assassination campaign they waged against Clinton. He has a lot of baggage that the Karl Roves of the GOP held back hoping he would be the nominee rather than Hillary and the Clinton campaign was so far ahead throughout the primary that they didn't need to dig out the oppo research. The American people were not going to vote for a socialist jew who promised them that their taxes would be raised to pay for other peoples health insurance and college tuition. I know that is a gross minimization of what Sander's campaign was all about but he was making promises that he could never have kept because he only had one Senator in his camp and five progressive house members. I really didn't want to see the good and decent guy subjected to the rank vilification of the GOP slander machine and figured Hillary could handle the abuse after being subjected to thirty years of it. Never counted on the FBI aiding DT
So you want a legal battle to take place in hopes of taking over the property of someone who you disagree with in order to establish an Islamic educational center?  Sounds familiar, watered down but familiar.
“The Enemy Isn’t Religion, It’s Homophobia”.  I disagree, Todd.  My great grandfather was Muslim via Morocco.  The alleged shooter was a Radical Muslim who slaughtered innocent people -- gays, transgenders, and straights. He even gunned down a mother of 11 or 12 children. He spared no one.  Harsh but these homophobic murderous Radical Muslims must be exterminated before they slaughter my gay fam and friends. When more of these homophobic murderous Radical Muslims who want all gays and transgenders to be dead return, they must be exterminated too. #LGBTQFlorida
No surprise that Trump and his  wife would lie about her immigration status.  It's a trait of pathological liars, which from the evidence both appear to be.
I agree 100% Mr. Tetpon.  For the past year, every time ADN published stories on the homeless (which many are Native), LGBT, or Alaska Native the bigots and racists reared their heads and ADN did little to nothing to stop the hate comments.

This is why I refer to them as trolls.  It fits the classic definition.  Try going to LifeSite and be a progressive Catholic and watch yourself get blocked in a nano-second.  To whit:  go there and watch the most vile stuff said about Francis, none of which will be deleted.
Excuse me, Bauer, but the law abiding citizens Black Lives Matter group are not a terrorist group.  Stop peddling your racism and ugly  bigotry.  Keep it in the smelly demonic bubble that you appear to live in.
Trump and the Pope together: Candidate Trump declared, “I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor [who the pope visited in the US] are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs" about contraception. The pope said: “Migrants should be treated according to certain rules, because migration is a right, but one which is highly regulated ... And if a country is only able to integrate 20 [refugees], let’s say, then it should only accept that many. If another is able to do more, let it do more,” he said. His Sect. of State Cardinal Parolin congratulated Trump: "The future leader has already spoken like a leader.” Trump and the Pope also agree on abortion and denying LGBTQI persons equal right.
Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.    So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam  Here is quote from their description of NOI:  "The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate."  I guess that you are OK with their bashing and denigrating of LGBT people too.   I condemn all hate groups listed on the SPLC website.   Do you???
It's 4:20 wrapping himself in religious costume. In his darkening view of the world, humor is a bright light that illuminates the truth and scatters the critters that operate in the shadows. So he shifts into low and claims GK needs anger management; I think 4:20 needs a year of Comedy Club on LGBT night and perhaps more. Garrison cuts to the chase with good humor and the sad fact that retreaded republicans have nominated a grown up Richie Rich who turned out to be a misogynist, racist, hate mongering windbag. And that's just for starters.
Maybe not Trump himself, but he brought in Mike Pence as VP. Google Mike Pence LGBT, and see all his battles against LGBT rights.
You don't throw out the value and dignity of human life expressed by the Pro life movement for the value and dignity of human life championed by the need for fair work and wages. Both are vital.  But if we don't recognize the value of life in the womb, the other, in its very essence loses meaning. Of course we must take care of the poor and homeless. But we need not neglect the sanctity of life to do so. We also need to fight against a system that encourages dependence on the government for living and thereby prevents the dignity that belongs to work. This in itself creates generational poverty. We could demand candidates that support both aspects of the sanctity of life - pro-life candidates from our progressive groups or pro living wage from our conservative groups. Alternatively, the Church ( and I do mean all who bear the Name of Christ) can stop expecting the government to do what Jesus told us to do - feed the poor , shelter the homeless, etc. and do it ourselves.
LGBT shouldn't have any rights for their cause in our country.. They are doing their best to push their beliefs on non believing LGBT.... They cry and have temper tantrums to make people feel bad about not supporting them.... Well I don't support them and they reap what they sew.... and will not inherit the kingdom of heaven.  God loves those that obey Him and keep his commandments and have faith in His Son Jesus Christ..
How did a discussion of the Clinton Foundation and the Trump Foundation become part of a discussion about ending violence toward the LGBT community and individuals?  Certainly, since Trump loudly blames others to draw attention away from his own failings, the comment in itself  is valid, but why here?
LGBTQ2 ??  Does anybody know what area that postal code is from?
I fail to see why any self-respecting woman or LGBTQ person would "drop into" a church which teaches they are fundamentally inferior by virtue of their birth.
Roy! I thought we had a positive relationship and open lines of communication! I feel betrayed by you! I just want to dialogue with my community & you are bullying me with your mansplaining! Of course a straight MALE like you feels like it's OK to tell me, a lesbian woman, to be silent! That right there is cis heteronormative male privilege! Triggered!!!
I've heard that Iranian commandos disguised in sombreros are massing on the border, just awaiting Obama's signal to invade and subject us all to fundamentalist Islam.  LGBTQs are secretly getting ready to blow up fundamentalist Christian churches at the moment of the Iranian attack, to deprive our people of desperately needed moral guidance.  Liberal Hollywood conspirators are planning to release a blockbuster movie in which Captain America wipes his ass with the American flag and joins ISIS.  Our way of life is in mortal danger, people.  Who alone can save us?
Common law marriages were valid, sacramental marriages until the Church began to impose conditions in order to address abuses. The Church has only ever spoken dogmatically when some initially held truth has come under attack and even then it has only done so out of the necessity of the prevalence of Truth.
Oh.   Based on "Drug use tends to adversely affect judgement in all groups." I thought you were trying to convince us that drug use was the problem rather than the fact that "Gay and bisexual men are the population most affected by HIV."  Obviously, I misunderstood your intent.
Debi:  Good point, I could have picked a better example. However, the LGBT community were once the ones getting "bashed", simply for being different, and for committing what were victim-less crimes.  Because of the victims, child molesters, if they do organize, they will have a much steeper hill to climb.  In theory, they could organize and create a nation-wide PAC ... and if the "tip of the iceberg" equation is anywhere near being a correct number, and if family and friend sympathizers are included, they could create a size-able voting block.  The ones who say "Never in my lifetime" may be correct, but simple observation could lead one to conclude that stranger things have happened.  It is theoretically possible that they could eventually fall under the umbrella of "Hate-Crime" protections, and that the SOR could be restricted from the public.  Currently, if someone related to you is on the registry, everyone in your extended family bears "The Mark" ... "Probably runs in the family"!
"Gay Marriage" is the great Heresy of our Age — a debate raging in the UMC, Episcopal/Anglican Churches, the Roman Catholic Church et al. — we faithful must have a DEEP understanding of all the issues involved: same-sex attractions, the LGBTQ political agenda, transgender ideology, and the anthropology of the family.  A brilliant talk on Homosexuality is made by the Rev. Paul Scalia (Antonin’s son) of the RC Diocese of Arlington — I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video -- it adds depth via logic & reason. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUXqgpbua9k
'Above all, love one another deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.   Show hospitality to one another without complaining.   As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another.…' (1 Peter 4:8-10)  You know well that your Catholic clergies rape children; do you still attend mass?   Do you boycott them too?  If you don't, then surely you are discriminating against just LGBT people?
" it goes against human nature" Mmmm, not always. There are variants to all things in nature. If I had my druthers, or had it been an option in my youth, I would have gladly been "normal". The fact is that the "normal" mold didn't fit, try as I might. The truth, the fact, the reality is that 1 on 10 people are homo, gay, queer, lesbian, that way, bat for the other team, kick with the other foot, jumped the fence, are lesbo, fag, dyke. I was raised by two heteros, God love them, but am homo just the same.
And the public part of the registry may be a failure, being a primary cause for under-reporting offenses, because who would want to report their brother or sister for fondling their kid, only to have that stain on their entire family, forever?  An effective registry of sorts had existed, long before, as the police knew who they were, and kept a mental track of the ones who were dangerous to more than their own family.  The families kept track of their own.  As you were growing up, did you ever wonder why "Uncle (or Auntie) (or Cousin) So and So" never showed up for holidays and stuff?  Some other unintended consequences of the public registry are:  The serial offenders are suddenly aware of just how many of them there are, and where, and they could possibly organize, just like the LGBT's did.  The Kiddy-Porn industry now has a nation-wide list of potential customers.  And several foreign countries have banned adoptions by Americans, as, in their eyes, we look like a nation of perverts.
Judah:  Your comment just screams "trolling".  Especially such a flippant last sentence.  I have what I believe to be a realistic expectation that "your kind" will eventually form PACs, much along the line of what the LGBT's did, and get some "protective" legislation passed.  However, Farmers don't kill all the snakes on their property, because they help keep the rats in check.  The LGBT's have pushed for tolerance of different lifestyles, which is a good thing for our state, and a sound reason for tolerating them.  I find it difficult to see exactly what benefit "your kind" will bring to Alaska, some rational which would persuade the majority of Alaskans to refrain from instinctively wanting to eradicate them.  If you really are "one of them", you might want to refrain from such flippant remarks, because it will not take a lot to provoke most Alaskans into finding legal ways to put "your kind" out of their misery.  Alaska is but one serious provocation away from Civil Commitment Laws!
Fully agree with this ^   Riders, whether they agree with my political stances or not, are undemocratic. In this case, they literally tried to attach language about LGBT in a military spending appropriation. Even if I agree or disagree with the amendment, it's still a scummy practice.
It seems many Liberals and socialists in  Canada dont really believe in gender equality, human rights, female emancipation,  LGBT human rights, and  free speech for all people after all. They vehemently denounce any defense of that sort of  stuff   because Muslims don't want it.  If it were Catholics  rejecting gay rights that would be an entirely different matter for the left. They want two contradictory moral codes in Canada,  where as Conservatives want one.  How does Islamic FGM fit into Ontario's OHIP coverage?
I get that people hate the idea of transgenderism, but transgenderism pronounces itself during early childhood development.  Transgenderism doesn't happen overnight.  The LGBT population has every right to socio-economic equality and fair justice same as heterosexuals.  I don't pretend to fully understand the LGBT population, but I don't believe any type of discrimination against this population is appropriate, or any group for that matter.  If we can only practice the live and let live concept.
Don't forget LGBT bathroom rights

Yeah, he's a real peach:  He signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.  He signed a bill that made it OK for Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers.  He blocked the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Indiana — and illegally tried to cut off federal aid to existing refugees.  He's an unreconstructed drug warrior.  He’s a hardcore Tea Partier.  He wasn’t always a Republican.  He’s got the Koch connection.
Most generally, anyone that goes after the LGBT community with a hot iron is likely one themselves.  We've seen that repeated throughout the TV so-called evangelists.
And you want to get a rise out of them because? Ever try leaving people alone? A lot of homeless young people have been kicked out by their families for one reason or another, sometimes because they're LBTG, and it would do no good for them to go back. Some are sexually exploited. We need to support the nonprofits that are trying to take care of them. They need shelter. Here is a link to a useful video about local homeless youth:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f6u_3RI3Hk
1.  If you do not like the rule, you resign your office.  You do not get to keep your cushy gov't paycheck and decide which laws you want to follow.  2.  It is illegal under the Civil Rights Act to deny protected classes services.  In some states, this includes LGBTQ people.    3.  People have the right to complain if denied a service.  They have the right to protest.
Jay, so you are comparing "liquor" to a "living" and breathing human who can't be free to go about society like the rest of us and order a cake.  No one has stopped you from ordering a cake where you like and if so you would be the first one to complain I am sure of it.  You obviously  dislike Muslims and LGBT's. Name one thing Christian's don't have the freedom to do in this nation? Got that right be a bigot and pretend it ain't so.
And at one time everyone believed the sun circled the earth and that slavery was okay with God, that adulterers should be stoned to death and on and on.  Marriage no longer only means a union between a man and a woman just as a man and a woman getting married no longer necessarily means they want to have children - but will have sex.  All this idea about marriage WAS ONCE all tied up in a neat little bundle - and it no longer is.  I don't think the Supreme Court was "perverting" the Constitution but was recognizing the fundamental equality of people to participate in the society and the "common good" created by that society.  At this point, LGBT marriage is accepted by a majority of citizens and I think the Supremes waited to make a decision until it was evident that there was that acceptance.  You may dispute the "liberty" of gay marriage all you want - but you have already lost the argument in the minds of lay Catholics and most citizens.
So you are a sane young black ( or non-white ) liberal college educated atheist woman ( or LGBT )...? ... or  were you born an insulting  ( mentally  challenged  ) tard. Oooops...turd.
Isn't it sad that our church has such an unhealthy view of sex and insists that it's adherents follow these unhealthy teachings. This is one reason the LGBT crowd is so steadfast in their position. Many LGBT are victims of the church "teachings" on sexuality and learned through much unnecessary suffering the error in these teachings.
Rich, is the fact that a "marriage" under the law, is nothing more than a civil contract have any meaning? then can it not be argued, that it is in fact, the state that is being discriminatory for not allowing you to enter into that civil contract? why does the LGBT community believe it is the people that are discriminating? to take it a step further and force your neighbors or people the choice to participate in that lifestyle, by acceptance, is not right either.
I think some readers are focused solely on the Pulse event as an act of gun violence. But the author is also writing about sexual aggression and her preference for gay bars as a place where straight women often feel more safe, free, and welcome to enjoy an evening of dancing (http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/02/opinion/sutter-change-alaska-rape/). Because her LGBTQ friends have always welcomed her, her compassion for that community is intense.   True, perception of fear and probability of harm do not always align. Just look at how people use anti-bacterial solutions or how citizens stockpiled guns and ammunition when Obama was elected. Many of my LGBTQ friends were psychologically stressed by the Orlando violence. They felt raw because they have experienced discrimination and hatred for most years of their lives. Now this. The author is primarily empathizing and offering her love and support to those who have supported her.
Walter, I represent the position of the majority of Police officers.   Are you a fellow officer?  If not then you have no clue what is really happening out in the real world involving the police and the BLM group.  My bias is from direct experience and 30 years of being employed as a police officer.   If your only information on the BLM is from the media then I would suggest you personally attend some of their meetings.  As I said above the problem is with the organizers, not the good willed protesters on the street.  Do you find it interesting that BLM has attempted to absorb other George Soros progressive causes such as LGBT, pro-choice, ect?    You should spend your valuable time addressing the issues of inner city violence, instead  of the false narrative that  young black men  should fear being executed by a law enforcement officer.  It is not true and deep down you know it.
I don't believe it's possible to be any more morally lower, sick and twisted then abusing the mentally ill....   Clinton organizers admitted on video tape to paying protesters to incite violence at Trump rallies. Some of those protestors democrats picked to incite violence were among the mentally ill in this country.  http://www.mrctv.org/blog/  “No, I’m saying that we have mentally ill people that we pay to do s***, make no mistake. Over the last twenty years. I’ve paid off a few homeless guys to do crazy stuff, and I’ve also made sure they had a hotel."
Well, I think you're wrong. The scriptures are worth discussing to anyone interested in Jesus of Nazareth  and early Christianity. And you clearly have no idea what Biblical scholars actually do.  Your argument is theological, not historical or textual. What you fail to grasp is that your beliefs or my beliefs are irrelevant to the issue of who wrote Hebrews and why. Text and historical criticism is evidence, not theology, based. If you can't compartmentalize that much, you're right, there's no basis for discussion.
<<To force some people to give up even the prospect of a healthy, mutual, life-giving love in all its wonderful forms is just plain cruel.>> And for some, at least, tragic. Tragedy manifests itself in self-loathing, irredeemable loneliness, alcohol/drug abuse and addiction, unhealthy and abusive relationships, sexual abuse, and suicide. It is important to assert that whatever value may be found for some people in the message and ministry of Courage, it is not the only option, and not always a good option, for GLBTQ Catholics.
Democrats have given millions of US jobs to illegal aliens and are now importing thousands of young Syrian Muslim males who, under Sharia law, treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all "infidels" must convert to Islam or die.  If illegal immigrants can find work so easily in America, why can't young black males?  Maybe Paul Scott knows.  Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?  Along with the Kennedy brothers, Bill Clinton is among the biggest womanizers in American history.
How the instruction was to be accomplished was not detailed .  Needless to say, there was no shortage of humorous comments from those evaluating the RFPs.  Especially from the LGB members.  (Sorry, transgender hadn't made it into the 'special rights' group yet).
If she is bisexual but married only to a man, the state is discriminating against her for not also letting her marry a woman. It's all about love and who are we to deprive bisexuals of a marriage to a member of each sex?
So is there an approved church list for the Portland Progressive community...I missed that at the last meeting. I thought Portlanders were ok with people doing and believing whatever as long as it didn't affect us. Mr. Bailey belongs to a church, and like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden, doesn't agree with their teaching on particular social issues. You all ready to pull your support from those two? Should they quit the Catholic church before you read another word from them?   As for Jules, I don't know him, and won't vote for him, but not because he goes to a church I do or don't agree with. Further, the comparisons on here of Imago Dei to the Westboro Baptist folks is out of bounds, and dare I say, hateful. The Christian faith, as practiced by ID requires certain things from them, and they take it seriously. I've also read their position papers, and there's barely a mention of LGBTQ issues and they certainly aren't targeting the community. The group think on this board is disappointing.
May I offer a little different slant from the others posted on this thread.  Donald Trump, in appealing to the right-wing zealots on a myriad of issues, did, in fact, make some very radical promises.  He promised mass deportations, he promised the "wall", he promised a ban on Muslim immigration, he promised a reversal of Roe v Wade, he promised to defund Planned Parenthood, he promised to end efforts to address climate change, he promised to radically modify or end our participation in NATO, he promised a reassessment and possible reversal of the position on same-sex marriage, he promised to support, under the guise of "religious freedom", discrimination against same-sex couples.  His supporters, it seems, believed him; after all, he won the election.  Are you suggesting these promises were just campaign hyperbole and he has no intention of keeping the very promises which helped elect him?  Are you suggesting those who would be the victims of those promises should just ignore them?
I remember this. I have several gay friends and hope that I live long enough to see the villainy of the Boyko's of the world diminished. I say lessened because I fear it will be past my days before LGBT people are truly treated equally. It can only happen when the religions that persecute this particular way of being are stripped of their power, and that will take time.
The parents think they know best just as the teenagers do.  When you were 15 or 16 just coming into your interest of the opposite sex, were you really concerned about what your parents or teachers told you was correct, or did you ultimately find out on your own?  Not every kid wants to have sex in high school, but for those that do,  I'm sure we can all understand that most of them will not be wanting direction from a teacher or a parent, but we should be understanding if they have questions.  I think we should stay out of something we discovered on our own as kids as our kids will do also.  Who can honestly say their first sexual experience with a boy or girl was guided by a sex Ed class or a concerned parent?
He might  have actually waited until Trump informed Canada that he was going to ask to re-open NAFTA before telling him how happy we were to accede to Trump's, at that point, unmade request. Sheeesh.  The US is not an ally in negotiating trade it is an opponent and you don't give your opponent *anything* without getting something in return. Trudeau made Canada look weak and eager to submit - not a great starting point.
Like you, we sent our kids to private and state schools.  They weren't interested in Catholic education, even Jesuit.  The scandal turned them off completely; and in the meantime, their eyes were opened to the overt misogyny and anti LGBT.  The church has lost them forever.  I'm pretty much gone since their open and enthusiastic support of Donald Trump, the least religious or spiritual man they could support.  He worships money and power--very similar to the hierarchy.
"Why would any woman, black or LGBT vote for a Democrat?" Because they want to.  Rethuglican's don't give a rip about them. They haven't for decades and they're not about to start now. You know 4:20, this is what extreme Christians want - "...treat women like dogs, believe homosexuality is punishable by death, and that all “infidels” must convert..." So what do you get when you cross a Christian radical with a Muslim extremist? A radical extremist.
The most unworthy of the entire cabinet in BC is Ms. Stillwell the Minister of doing nothing for the poor and needy. After decades of having real rates of social assistance cut...making it necessary for the poor to beg or starve....denying welfare to kids thrown out on the street...often LGBTQ....which then leads them to prostitution and drug dealing or god knows what....this government...with a huge billion dollar plus surplus....and money to overspend by hundreds of millions on a nw roof for BC place.....not on transit...not on education..not on post secondary education....not on preserving our limited farm land...she  gave poor people a few dollars more...and then told the poor..that if they wanted the money...they had to give up a bus pass. That was Ms..Stillwell.  She then told  the poor people about how she too experienced poverty.....and pulled herself up by her own efforts. And that they shouldnt complain. tho she received much better assistance than BC poor do
Hillary Clinton is not a sexual predator.  She is not an extension of her husband, and you should remember that.   There are scores of actual incidents attributed to Donald Trump, who repeatedly was broadcast on Howard Stern bragging about his many conquests while dehumanizing those women.  There is even a court case coming up in December where Trump is accused of raping of a 13 year old girl.  Where there's smoke, there is fire.  Bill Clinton is not running for president.  If you want to make that the issue, can we mention Melania Trump's pornographic poses and paint Trump with that brush as well?
Kate Brown went out-of-her-way to state that she is bisexual.
Oh for the love...not every woman that dislikes Hillary, or is against women priests is a self-loathing misogynist. Some of us reject the notion that all women should want the same things, think the same way, and behave the same way and have decided for ourselves to be better than the feminist movement makes women out to be. Belief in an all-male clergy doesn't make me subservient, it makes me faithful. Do not mistake my faithfulness for weakness or self-loathing.
Like the Alaska Dispatch, most of those involved with the Black Lives Matter organization are radical Marxists. Furthermore, Black Lives Matter is funded by the Hungarian billionaire, George Soros, who was a Hitler Youth that helped roundup Jews during WWII. He pays everyone at BLM at least $15/hr to stir up trouble and create racial tension in the U.S. Of course, ALL LIVES MATTER, and anyone who doesn't think so, is by definition, a racist. According to the USDOJ, Cops kill about 250 black people a year, but kill over 600 whites and hispanics a year, and in 99.9% of those cases, those people posed a genuine threat to the life of the officer, or they wouldn't have been shot. In a nation of 320 million folks, there's always going to be bad people and bad cops. We don't live in Utopia. More people a killed by slipping in their bathtubs than are killed by police officers each year, so this is all much ado about nothing, which is what radical Marxists specialize in.
What about understanding and compassion for folks who feel the LGBTQ lifechoices are unhealthy and unnatural?  Why are some moral values repressed and condemned by the left, and others endorsed?  That's where the discrimination is.
As a gay person you don't like to be slammed and called all of the things that you just stated, but you sure don't  seem to mind being a hypocrite and slam straight people with that do  you?  And you wonder why there are a lot of straight people that won't tolerate your actions and attitudes.   And if you aren't gay,  you just fell into the "gullible" "mindless" warrior for lgbt group.
I wish the Detroit Archdiocese well in this endeavor.  I hope Vigneron really does, first of all, assure people can talk about issues of real concern to them in their faith and the evangelization of that faith.  If he has done that, there will be a lot of discussion about LGBT people, about their lives, their faith, their capacity to love and contribute.  And, then,  I hope Vigneron really does listen with an open mind and an open heart.
After reading the article and most of the comments, I think that each of us should take the responsibility to encourage every young person (of any camp) that we know to visit the website mentioned by Bishop Fabio Fabene.  Young People, whatever their connection to the Church, ought to take the opportunity to tell the Church whatever is true about their spiritual life, experience, quest, needs.
No, when someone says "I see a lack of love in the Church", that's what they mean. Things like the way our LGBT brothers and sisters are rejected, that women are deemed inferior to men, things like that.
I will agree, I have broad brushed Nikiski, but not by much.  Having grown up here I have every right to point out the oozing dysfunction that infects mindset of a majority of the residents.    Look at the website of the people pushing this agenda, they want to provide absolutely nothing of value but wish to pocket the tax money for it.
"It is time for the bishops to commission a reputable survey to determine what percent of their priests are gay.   They should also do a survey to determine the reaction of their flock to the reality of gay priests."  Yes.  Yes.  It is long since past time for bishops to face reality and learn how to deal with it.  This pretense that all priests are heterosexual and never have sex is just ridiculous.  Equally ridiculous is the idea that Catholics are united in the way the bishops and the Vatican treat LGBTQI people, whether they are priests or not.    Bishops need to know how much what they do is supported and not supported.  In this day and age, it matters - we do not live in an age of authoritarian "divine right" rulers - and that includes bishops.  More, though, bishops need to listen to the heart of the people of faith - the Holy Spirit speaks in those hearts, too.  They also have to learn to be brave and not cave to loud mouthed bigots.  Bishops - listen and learn.
The Globe report (Dec 23) on multiparent LGBTQ "families" as formulated by the All Families Are Equal Act, tells us why groupings created by law are not equal to families created by nature. Unlike the quartet of "parents" featured in the report, natural parents do not "set out their intentions in a 12-page document they call the Family Council Charter." They do not need to put in writing "laundry, grocery and wake-up duties," nor have "a lot of schedules to factor in," nor check their planners to "map out the next few months" as to who in the group will do what and when and especially where, given there may be two, three or four households. A full list of parental duties does not exist. Biological parents do these things instinctively, naturally. They are there full-time and not limited by schedules and planners and duty rosters. No law can change nature. As Abraham Lincoln observed, "How many legs does a dog have? Four. Calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg.
Alaska Libertarian Platform and Joe Miller: They support limited constitutional government.  Miller wants legislators to elect US Senators, not citizens.   They support the Bill of Rights for every individual.  Miller says fine, except for LGBT people and women who choose abortion. They only strong advocate of private property rights.  Joe Miller agrees, especially if he can continue to hide his Mat-Su property and his Kansas farm subsidies. Sounds like a match made in heaven.
People aren't born lgbt, it's a concious choice they make as they get older. People are born mix,white,black, asian and into many different cultures by no choice of their own.
$313,844,430,000 of government debt, and rising at a rate of about $1,000 ever 3 seconds.  How about you?  Gay marriage outlawed?  Abortion access restricted?  Schools not teaching evolution any more?  Throw us a bone from your basement closet NTA.
Xavier:  Actually, there's nothing to be accomplished by responding to your angry personal attacks.  Address issues and I'll be happy to have a civil conversation with you on any topic.      If you do, in fact, "feel very much a part of Boise's black lesbian community", I'm sure they're happy to have your support and I honor you for providing it.   BTW: As I've mentioned to you previously, if you find I've made "untrue" statements of fact, please let me know so I can correct them.  I don't intentionally "lie" about anything and I don't want you to have the impression that I do.  Thanks, Gary
You guys missed reviewing Stag, only the finest all-make review club in Portland.  There's several reasons why they attracted the best male dancers in Portland. Check it out... It's great fun for everyone, straight OR gay! 😜
Well, Chicago is a place where there is a very visible Ukrainian presence.  My daughter went there for a conference a couple of months ago, along with her husband and daughter.  Her husband is learning Ukrainian and was delighted that people in stores knew that he was speaking Ukrainian with my granddaughter.  One saleswoman even knew a couple of words in Ukrainian.  :-) Because I bless myself differently than do RCs, I've had many people ask me if I was really a Catholic and express surprise at the fact that I would be allowed to receive Communion at a Catholic Church.
We keep hearing there are lots of jobs out there, but agree we don't see many.
Jennifer, are you on Clinton's payroll?  Why would any respectable, intelligent woman or man vote for or support a liar, thief and disreputable sexual predator enabler like HRC?
Wasn't this post removed once before? Don't see any vile hate at Christianity or Jesus Christ. You, on the the other hand, are called out for your misogyny, racism, homophobia, and general BS.
Give a professor a job. Do a study. Spend more money on additional studies. Do nothing. The gas line could have been built with the money they used to study it. Twice over! Are the wind turbines at Ferry running or idle. How about the ones on Fire Island? Still or spinning? You look. You see for yourself. Government grants, subsidies and studies. That is where the money is spent. But try and actually do something yourself and you will find a ton of regulations and resistance preventing you from actually accomplishing anything except paying for more studies. . .
"in the last phase of Anchorage's 40-year war over LGBT rights"  The LGBT movement didn't exist 40 years ago but OK....
Wes, it is important for the children of these women to know that they are not alone.  That people care about them.  For some, it is the first time they have experienced kindness.  That is a MAJOR life skill.
You seem to miss the point: Imago Dei members - at least if they have integrity with the publicly stated beliefs their Conservative Baptist denomination - feel same-sex couples are unworthy of marriage in the eyes of God, and that such marriages are a cause of "grief" and "mourning". Similarly, they consider women unworthy of church leadership.   Yes, as a church in the USA, you and your fellow Imago Dei members can believe whatever you choose. But, you shouldn't act surprised when others treat you as poorly as your church treats women and LGBTQ people.
Does t-rump realize how much money we owe China? Oh wait, he'll just refuse to pay them the over 1 TRILLION dollars like he does with people that have worked for him.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/20/guns-on-university-campuses-the-colorado-experience/  If it is a right, then whether it increases or decreases violence is immaterial. And black people, and PDA's by LGBT, were divisive at points in our history. Should that trump the peaceable exercise of fundamental rights?
Well said, Jim.   Being of about the same age as Mr. Granas, I well remember when history was all about the "Winning of the West" from the "savages;"  There were virtually no places blacks could live outside of the Portland Metro area, and "we reserve the right to refuse service" signs  really meant it;   Our  Japanese citizens faced discrimination when they came back from the camps after WWII;  Our HS Indian running back was known by the media as "Denny Super Chief Baker; " Girls had no competitive sports, and women were less likely to go to college, especially law school;  and the LGBT community?  Given our ignorance, they didn't even exist for us "back in the day" except we'd heard if you wore green socks on Thursday you were "queer", whatever that was. Mike, go back to the Good Old Days when we were young?   In some ways yes, but Not in these areas of social equality and fairness!
You forgot another primary vector....bi-sexual men and prostitutes.     Many of whom are found near gambling locations.    I once did a Request for Proposals for DHS to seek ways to reduce HIV.  One of the proposals I got was to get a $50,000 grant to teach prostitutes how to put condoms on their customers.  They proposed to instruct 250 Portland area prostitutes.  That would have been $200.00 per prostitute.    We gave the grant to someone else.
Father Hall, look on the bright(er) side.  You could be ministering to the Catholic faithful on the other side of the Delaware River in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.    Yes, indeed, our current spiritual leader, when he was leading the Catholic faithful in Denver, Colorado, deemed it necessary, right, appropriate, etc. to support the local Catholic elementary school's pastor decision to deny enrollment for children registering for the elementary school because their parents were lesbians.  Of course, a similar incident, i.e., of kicking an excellent religion teacher to the curb because of her homosexual relationship, occurred at Waldron Mercy Academy in June 2015.  Bishop Myers and Archbishop Chaput - perfect together !  Father, thank you for your work, diligence and service to all people of faith.  Michael Skiendzielewski Captain            (Retired) Philadelphia Police Dept. St. Joseph's University, 1974
Once again, we have a religious opinion about a psychological/medical condition, and the pretty good body of research accumulated in the past 10-15 years regarding it be damned.  A celibate man, dressed in robes and capes, thinks he knows enough to lecture the rest of the world on a matter he clearly knows very, very little about.  How convenient - and easy- it is for some men of the Church to victimize a group that possesses little power.  Why not? - they've been doing it to young people, LGBT folks, the divorced-remarried and women for centuries.  If Pope Francis steps in the middle of this (well, any further then he has already) he will be creating another albeit minor version of Paul VI's disaster with Human vitae.  The entire matter of "gender theory" as presented here, is a made-up Church version, based on disinformation and a purposeful rejection of what science, and personal experience, informs us about now that many of us choose to listen.  We already know the Church doesn't.
At least the bishops boldly confronted the needs of Catholic LGBTs by having Cardinal Dolan wax poetic on Courage.
Your facts are backwards Nick. The republicans have not changed and become the racist party that the democrats were as late as the late 60's, when they refused to seat a black delegation on the convention floor in 1968. The democratic party did not change in the 40's, the party started to change and that is what got the dixiecrats started. After they failed in the 1948 election, all but 4 went back to the democratic party. Those 4 became republicans, mainly due to economic policies. Like you, I believe we do not need racists but unfortunately, we have them and fortunately for republicans, they are still mainly liberal/progressive politically. There are one or two that say they are republican but no honest republican will have anything to do with them.
What's the matter little feller?  Wavemaker, Tell The Truth, and JPZ got your craw?  All day long man, all day long.  Ain't life a B?
"And I can actually imagine the people on the right jumping gleefully that they can now treat women, immigrants, LGBT, and poor with total disregard for humanity, respect and compassion. Break a leg during your show!"  Trump stated specifically that he was going to protect gays during his acceptance speech.  You're just going with a narrative because you're a Simple Simon partisan who does not question what he is told by the media.  Where is the evidence that Trump is anti-gay?  Where is it?  You say stupid crap like "alt-right and "Breitbart."  THE EDITOR OF BREITBART IS FLAMBOYANTLY GAY!  The editor of the London office is MUSLIM.  How stupid do you have to be, to actually believe the lies that the mainstream media tells you?
So what has the Gasping Old Party learned since its 'autopsy' of 2012 (and 2008) - they continue to alienate women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minorities, Millennials, LGBTs, non-saber rattlers, people who care for our planet.  No Republican can win the presidency with a constituency of old, angry, Bible thumping white folks. The votes simply are not there in today's tumble of real world diversity  - one they refuse to acknowledge and embrace.   As for Lisa, she is increasingly speaking to Alaskans with a forked tongue while appeasing the GOP and her campaign contributors. Disappointing.
As usual, this discussion quickly  degenerated in to the usual knee-jerk reactions for and against guns and Muslims.  Only Listening to Grasshoppers seemed  to focus on the tragic deaths themselves--could it be that it's because folks assumed the victims were mostly LGBT?  L2G:  "My deepest condolences to the victims, family and loved ones. Then the YouTube star and XVoice runner up, young Christina Grimmie, 23, shot and killed in Fla..........I’m just sick to my stomach. It’s all too much.     To those lost may you rest in peace and may God have mercy on their souls. l2g".  .................................Thank you L2G
Sorry, but since the so-called "Cardinal Newman Society" shows zero tolerance towards our LGBT brothers and sisters, I cannot find any tolerance for them in my heart. As far as I am concerned, they are reaping what they sowed.   Fear and loathing for our LGBT brothers and sisters is NOT a Christian virtue.
I like the photo of the guy riding in a car with the sign that says:  I'm the NRA and I support the LGBT community. Great weekend event LGBT community.  See you in the July 4th Parade.  Be Loud and Proud.  Peace to all of you!
Our pope needs to seriously deal with the half of the church he has been continuously ignoring, women, and deliver them equal ordination immediately.  Otherwise, I see a real reason for stress developing for him in 2017, and for reasons of human dignity.  Women are not going to stand for being told no - the church won't ordain women priests or make women cardinals any longer.  Its time to fight folks if justice is not given fully and immediately!  Join WOC now!  Women's Ordination Conference.  Fight for our church to be one worth attending - a Just Church of Christ - no more women hating rules!
Why is it on this post today that we have a second comparison to the LBGT community being like "Muslims and alcohol". For the life of me I shake my head and cannot fathom any connection or comparison to the "feelings of alcohol" and the "feelings of a real human being".  The only answer to your ideals of sexual immorality is to do what you believe not to be moral sexually and let others do the same. The bible tells you what to do so you say, but not all people share you views and because of your overt demonizing others who you have never met this is one reason why citizens of the US are dropping out of organized religion and will continue to do so.
Hello, Dennis!!! Please tell me it's really you! I've found several here now who are not who they claim to be and it's very sad! You still sound like yourself, Lol!  I am in good shape for the shape I'm in, which is round, (but a little less round!)  Still fighting the good fight!  This election has me so depressed. As an Independent, I must say that I have my reservations about both candidates but, Trump is so horrible and the Republican Party platform itself is so offensive to LGBT folks, non-Christians, minorities, women, the elderly, the poor, children, and so on, that I wouldn't vote for a Republican right now if you paid me! (and I really need the money since the Republicans have cut my food stamps to $4/week! Let the Donald try to eat on that!)
I agree, John, as that has been my experience too, even though my sons were immersed in Catholic school and parish activities as kids.  Their cynicism began with the pastor's emphasis on incessant fund raising and solidified with the child sexual abuse horror.  Their children neither understand nor respect the institutional Church's positions on women and LGBT persons, even though they have all attended Catholic schools through high school, and one has chosen to continue her education at a Catholic university.    Your final sentence is absolutely true for me and my family.
The tired old "they weren't catechised" isn't good enough.  These people are saying things like "we see a lack of love in the Church". Instead, they see leaders who cover up sexual abuse, who reject their LGBT brothers and sisters, who fail to lead.  Why should they associate themselves with the Catholic Church?
I wonder how many Pro-Potheads have live anywhere else than Eugene. This place is FILLED with lazy unproductive people and has one the the lowest graduation rates in the country. Kids are taught it is better to smokeout than get a good education and a job and raise kids that grow up to be productive responsible adults. And these examples of Rich Pro-Pothead people you guys give are ridiculous, i am talking about the lower-middle class kid who sees no way out and turns to drugs to "get by".
You go too far all the time, Craig.  If you live in Anchorage, you're always bashing the homeless, Natives, low-income, and the LGBT populations.  The only population that you don't seem to bash is the Caucasian middle class.  Don't try to hide behind national statistics because I know you don't bother to do any research.  It's crystal clear that innuendo and accusations is good enough for you.
No they're not.  It's nobody's business how people vote.  Anyone tries to come up and ask me how I voted I'd give them the middle finger salute.
I think you're projecting a little. Just because you happen to disagree with some other commenters doesn't make them savage wife-beaters and women-haters. Perhaps rethink who exactly is posting hateful comments here.
Justine believes that girls should be boys and boys should be girls.  He's also introducing legislation to legitimize any sexual identity, LBGTQRSTUVXYZ, Two Spirited, Intersex, and 13 other 'genders'.    So just like his views on anything, he's wishy washy and inconsistent, and his solution is to write a cheque with other people's tax money to push the agenda of these lobby groups.
My general view point is that I disagree with the Pope's views on Gender and Sexuality, but I "understand" where he's coming from. From his perspective as an Argentine cleric and the first leader from the global south he sees the changes in our attitudes on Gender and Sexuality as a Western ideological construct which is why he uses the phrase "ideological colonialism" a lot. I know as someone from the Caribbean that my family says the same thing a lot of the time.   I would say in response to that that Pope Francis has to understand that it is people's lived experiences. Not just a construct. And also homophobia is itself a legacy of Western imperialism in the Third World. My other thoughts though would be that it is good that he speaks about "accompanying people in the LGBTQ community and not condemning them.
Thing is you don't get to choose how other people do gender performance. The fact that you need to continually comment on how to "man" correctly says much more about you than it does about a purse carrying man. Why does it bother you so much? If you are constantly policing your own gender presentation to make sure its "manly" enough maybe you should sit down and think about why that is.
Yes, I imagine the principles of satanism as it is practiced by most non-mentally-ill adherents is probably close to libertarianism - free will, reason (thus the reference to "eating the tree of knowledge"), and self-reliance. Probably principles many Alaskans would identify with, that is until you attach that dirty word "satan" to them. Funny how that works.
Touche', there, 63.  I have the exact sentiment.  As long as there's bigots and racists that like to stick their heads up every time ADN publishes a story on Alaska Natives, the homeless, the LGBT, or any other vulnerable group, I'll be there to fend them off.  So should others that have decency and ethics.  There's a big difference in having an opinion but when it's laced with hate garbage than all bets are off.
If your scared about Trump on this one, I wouldn't be.  Guy who was on the cover of Playboy and who bragged openly about the number of women he could grope because he was famous isn't interested in policing people's sex lives.  I'm much more concerned about the man's overall temperment and his playing patty cake with the neo-facists on the alt-right.  But on matters like abortion, gay marriage, etc., he has essentially conned the social conservatives.
You're a Post Truth liar.   Title X funding cannot be used for abortions, and the Hyde Amendment only allows abortion cases involving rape, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.
Ms Tesa Ann, so how do you feel about the rash of attacks across the country on Muslim people, gay people, non-white people, female people -- by people who are using Trump's "victory" as an excuse to bring their hate out into the open? I am assuming, of course, that you haven't cloistered yourself and are aware (by accessing non-right wing media) that this is taking place. Do you think that Trump supporters like you are okay with painting swastikas on cars and churches, chanting "build the wall" in a mixed-race middle school cafeteria, yelling at women "we own your pussy now", ripping the hijab off of Muslim womens' heads, screaming at Hispanic people to "get back to your own country" is okay? This is what you have unleashed. Deal with it, honey.
Great article Sylvia.  Fair and balanced with facts, not emotion or political motivation.  Me thinks you are anything but a "dumb haole" as you decribe yourself.
I agree--Kag nailed it. And so has MikeAA. Trump has no centre except himself since he's probably a narcissist. He does what he needs to do in the moment. Trump doesn't fundamentally care for issues like abortion or marriage equality because they don't impinge on Trumpland and are merely cards to play in order to gain some type of advantage. I'll bet good money that Trump has never thought of the fate of a single unborn child other than his own kids before they were born. (Safe to say any surprises have been terminated.) As for marriage equality, the guy has no pulse for this stuff and with Big Business often backing LGBT interests, this is a lost cause. I am surprised more people could not figure this out.
Hillary has taken on her share of tough fights. Here are just a few of the biggest things she’s accomplished. 1. Fought for children and families for 40 years and counting.       2. Helped provide millions of children with health care.     3. Helped get 9/11 first responders the health care they needed.     4. Told the world that “women’s rights are human rights.”               5. Stood up for LGBT rights at home and abroad.     6. Helped expand health care and family leave for military families.       7. Negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
Yes,  Every mosque in Canada  should open its doors and  have a pot luck dinner, invite Jews  and member of the LGBT communities  for a big meal to celebrate their integration into one  big happy Canadian family.
Where's the "H" in LGBTQ?  Did these silly people forget that 90% is still hetro?
I believe voters wanted to improve the opportunities for kids learning useful trade skills in school but either didn't think about where the funds would come from, didn't care, or found M97 too unpalatable to include as a funding source. As a consequence, per the upper level Oregon administrator I got an email from, it added an estimated $300M to the budget deficit.
Compromise justice?  Compromise human rights?  Because some public service providers think their "religious freedom" requires them to refuse to serve LGBTQ citizens? Even though Jesus never said a word about LGBTQ people? And even though they serve divorced  citizens, although Jesus said not to divorce?  What a great idea.
"Catholic laity are amongst the most supportive of civil marriage equality." True. However: It is not the laity who are afforded greater respect & reverence by legislators, it is the clergy. Legislators (particularly o the right of the political spectrum) appear to bend over backwards to accommodate the will & thinking of the clergy. It is generally not Catholic laity taking action in the courts on matters of LGBT rights. But the Catholic clergy certainly do (a perfect example of this was the constitutional court challenge to Uganda's toxic anti homosexuality law. Catholic laity were nowhere to be seen in that court case, but the Catholic clergy petitioned the court to stand in defense of that toxic and violent law).  All you have done is point out the human shield of "nice people" surrounding the more rabidly homophobic among the clergy. You have deflected attention onto the cloak of disguise worn by the inherently homophobic core.
I am so glad to see that these young ladies are selling from central locations.  When I sold cookies in the 1950's, we lugged cartons from house to house by ourselves---its much smarter and safer to do it this way!
Heather Knight was also one of the draftees of the document "An Understanding of the Biblical View of Homosexual Practice and Pastoral Care."  It is important to note that Jonathan Henderson was under her wing during her tenure at PUC. So what is so important about this? Well, Henderson—a chaplain and pastor at PUC, has preached a series of abominable sermons promoting the LGBT agenda in the SDA church. Once you you read that 21 page document and listen to Henderson's sermons, you will realize that there's is a well planned agenda to promote homosexuality in the church. Here are a couple of clips of the Sermons "Adam and Steve" and Coming Out, Coming In"  1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fW3FHFWj7g 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAT6P4GB-do  Here are the complete sermons. You have to pray a lot before you watch these:  1. COMING OUT, COMING IN https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNWUxZZgWU&t=2908s  2. ADAM AND STEVE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asqUWRhcjlc&t=1485s
Maybe you don't follow politics very closely, but Trump is pro universal healthcare. He is just willing and able to say that Obamacare doesn't work in its current form. This is where he and GOP differ. They want America's to buy their own health insurance like they used to, but are now willing to give them a tax credit to help pay for it. Trump wants the government to cover them with some form of federal health care coverage, just not what Obama put in place because, let's face it, it's been a disaster. Trump, being from New York, is actually very liberal. Even during the campaign trail everyone called him a leftist. The GOP itself said he wasn't a Republican. He is pro LGBT, he is pro universal health care, he is pro immigration (but very anti illegal immigration). Try to understand where he stands on the issues before commenting.
It was always a bit of a mystery to me why Fr. Brown came to be such a lightning rod for the right-wingers.  He was, exactly as you say, a careful, moderate scholar who made enormous contributions to Catholic theology and biblical studies.
oh...my son lost his job to government subsidized immigrants. ------------------------------ Justin's priority is Diversity - First Nations, LGBT, immigrants, refugees  Your son apparently is not part of Diversity and must go to the back of the line in Justin's vision of Canada Treason?
Exactly, Ivan Putski.  Every time a news story is published about the homeless, Alaska Natives, rural Alaska, or the LGBT community the usual suspects rear their bigot racists heads.  What's striking is that they never tire of it.
"Anchorage LGBT rights law opponents seek amendments through initiative" sounds pretty accurate to me...  If they headlined as, “Perverts who want to go into opposite sex restrooms opposed by normal human beings”, as you suggest, readers would think they were talking about priests.
A ridiculous article.  ..."it was an existential attack on the entire LGBTQ community, particularly gay people of color." Ohhh Pleeease!   As  Xavier_Malcolm stated: "...we’re not buying into the drama of the BLT-GQ pity party."
Better to fear Trump and try and get rid go him, than wander around in a stupor thinking he's the man for the job. Unless the job is making corporate America extremely nervous. Or the job is making American Muslims extremely nervous. Or making LGTBQ extremely nervous. Or seniors. Or working class Americans. Or America's trading partner to the north. Or China. Or Europe. Or everyone except Putin. Is that Trump's job?
Notice that in:  "AS A GROUND FOR HUMAN DIALOGUE, I dispute both your premise 'there is only one truth' and your presumed opposite 'there are multiple truths.' Neither proposition correctly captures the state of the question about truth through human history."  Dennis changes the topic from truth - which is the existence of an objective reality outside our perception of it and correspondence of our subjective appreciation of it to objective reality - to the topic of consensus among humans on what is true.  This is a viewpoint prevalent at this blog - objective reality is irrelevant and what we feel about things is as important or more important than what they are.  Thus same sex marriage, gender flexibility, and abortion may all be "goods", while the reality of a natural law is denied, which of course denies a good portion of the divine law.
Don't leave out local queers who would parade the riverfront trolling for "seafood" as they called it.
Hillary is so badly tainted that she will never be affective even if she does lie, cheat and steal her way into the Whitehouse. Her 4 years if she doesn't fall out of bed, doesn't od on the drugs she's on or manages to stay out of jail, will be turbulent at best.  Nobody likes her, most are voting the party line and that's sad when they lower themselves that far down, goes for both sides however.  The Clintons have never produced anything but overpriced words, and those they reaped from public office. Nothing, absolutely nothing, and don't sell me the foundation pooh. It's a vehicle for those rich to pay themselves and their cronies, peddle influence and wield power.  Hillary talks about Trump and the nuke codes? Hillary wouldn't know what laptop, cell phone or who even has it. As careless as she is and I say that with a grain of salt, it's more hiding thing, I would worry that Putin and a host of others would get it from her or her cronies.   You really think she cares about anyone?
If ADN really wants "civil comments" why are they printing uncivil letters to the editor like the one from, August Cisar?  I had my posts deleted, for far less inflammatory comments.
Totally agree, star trek in the park was a blast! So fun, so sad they're no longer doing it.
I think what you are saying is important.  Francis is saying, in an indirect way, that all that sub rosa discernment is okay.  He is making it known that this is a process that does have value and can be officially recognized.  The issues of sin, forgiveness, and the state of grace of ones soul are not issues for public gossip and not subject to approval or judgment of others.  (I am not fond of those who think they have to tattle on LGBT people or bishops who promote this by worrying so much about "scandal".)  It is actually none of the business of other parishioners and bishops and priests need to make that clear.  It is an issue for an individual and a spiritual guide (always the parish priest?) to discern.  I can also see how it is hard to write a set of rules.   Maybe the problem is that the process has been based on rigid legalistic rules.   It is hard to let go of the rigidity of a legalistic process and return this to a spiritual process.
You see some of the old clergy rape victims are better off getting some hush money handout at C. D’s discretion?   And hide CI (Catholic Institution) criminal behavior of hiding and condoning clergy rapes of children is find to you?      So what kind of faith journey are you leading?    You are not saying that God of Catholic is OK with clergy rape of children?   Who wants to worship God with the child rapist organization?      In that case, why bother with religion at all?  Surely the child rapists are OK by CI, divorced/remarried or LGBT fork are angels and even abortion are OK too since the clergy rape victims kill themselves often.       What kind morality one grew up with to not see that the clergy child rapes can’t co-exist with any kind of religion?
You must not have read the comments on Shannyn Moore's commentary yesterday then.
Does that respect for others' opinions apply equally for those whose expression of their opinions, in the opinion of A-Today editors, moderators and the majority of participants, makes it more "difficult to save the globe from our own human hands," more difficult for those trying to advance the WO agenda, or more difficult for those of the LGBTQ community to find affirmation in SDA congregations?  When I read a recent invitation to a "One Project" gathering, I noticed that at tables for discussions following each sermon, younger people were to be segregated from older attendees. How convenient that must be to keep young, impressional minds from being able to consider alternate, more traditional viewpoints. While I do like the feature of "civil comments," whereby we are notified by e-mail when someone has responded to our comments, the whole set-up smacks of the Emergent Church world view whereby group consensus, rather than proper exegesis of Scripture, determines what is acceptable.
I assume from all of this, that Fr James Martin welcomes all his LGBT congregation to join with him in the sharing of the eucharist at each mass?  If Fr James Martin has no problem with this, then he needs to encourage his fellow priests to do likewise.
It seems to me that Archbishop Chaput just does not know how to evangelize those who are not on the same page as he. It might be helpful if he took some lessons from Pope Francis.
Ray,  Communion was given to all desiring to receive it. Many "issues" remain and until Pope Francis can further appoint more progressive Bishops I don't see any significant changes in these "issues". I believe Fr. Martin is talking about establish a dialogue between the hierarchy and the LGBTQ community. The first step is willingness on the part of both parties. BTW, what has been accomplished at my parish took considerable preliminary dialogue. Again, this occurred in San Francisco and it may not be possible in other parts of the country. If it's not possible, then seeking other faith communities can be a good option.
Canada's once vaunted military is now a shadow of itself.  This country has had a very proud history of its military and the military's warriors.  Brothers-in-arms rarely turn on their own.  I call bull hooey on this article.  All of a sudden we've got gays, lesbians, trannies, minorities coming out of the woodwork, screaming bigotry, racism, yada, yada, yada.  Canada's military is losing its edge.  I put this down to the politically correct leaders.  God forbid we have warriors to defend us.....rather lets fight our enemies from computers, where it's safe.  Spare me.  Let those who want to be a part of a real military, be our heros.  Those that joined for any other reason need to find other employment.
Mr. Greenblatt are you saying white people shouldn't vote? Black people voted for Obama just because he was black why can't white people do that same for a white guy? Also you're digging us all into a hole here. The black panthers, a historical racist and terrorist organization came out and publicly endorsed Obama. Where were you then? Where was you political bashing then? Or do you only attack white people?
In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, the news is flooded with reports of abuse, assault, and harassment, largely of minorities, by jubilant Trump supporters celebrating the ascent of their candidate, a candidate who campaigned by appealing to white heterosexual Christian supremacy.   Over the past 48 hours, women have been assaulted for wearing the hijab, property has been defaced with swastikas, LGBT Americans have been threatened, and African Americans have experienced election result-specific harassment by fellow Americans touting the election of Donald Trump as the dawn of a new America, apparently one where they consider that the ugliest of racial and social animus to have the seal of presidential approval.
Why is it so important for you that there be continued discrimination against LGBT folks?
I find these high-power semi-automatic guns offensive, not only because of how recent the most deadly attack in US history occurred just weeks ago, but also because it is Pride Month and the most deadly attack in US history was also the worst hate-crime to ever happen against LGBT people. And now, for entertainment, the Shooting Sports Fair is to take place on US soil in blatant disrespect to the LGBT community here.
There were a few thousand people enjoying a wonderful gathering on the park strip:  community laughing, hugging, visiting old friends, making new friends.  A few thousand:  acceptance and supportive. And four (two left after about an hour), two who were unhappy and were shouting their misunderstanding of community in general and of Christianity specifically. Several times members from the real community surrounded the lone shouters to sing, hold up flags and signs and cheer.  There may have been a small, brief encounter - but there were hundreds who would like to have chased them off but just smiled.  The news is focusing on the wrong thing.  It was an incredible event with 150 booths, music, dancing, laughter and good feelings. In the end love and real community always win.  I am proud of Anchorage - it was a beautiful coming together!  Were there two dissenters there?  I feel sorry for them.
If people feel that the LGBTQ lifestyle is unhealthy then they have the right to not participate in it. That's the extent of their rights.  I feel, for example, that passing judgment on these people is immoral so I have the right not to do it. So I don't.
Anyone with ties to the Chinese politburo should be highly suspect.
And Black Voters, Hispanic Voters, LBGT Voters, etc... But nice try, NYT! There is a reason your profits are down over 95%...
We have to get rid of the Ontario Liberals.  They are destroying this province.  First, they hound the Bowmanville Zoo out of business, now they want Marineland shut down.  They are crazy and in bed with the craziest radicals.  In addition to ruining Hydro, and promoting gay sex.
After following the link you sent and reading the information in it, I don't understand where you are getting the impression that "The 1st Amendment Defense Act" would [unjustly] discriminate against LGBT and others based on religious grounds.  Please describe and explain the discrimination that you are speaking of, and please keep in mind my added comment about "justness or unjustness" when you do.  Many of our laws are rightfully discriminatory against certain people and groups for very well-founded and just reasons, so what are the unjust discriminations you're speaking of?
Your last sentence is flat out untrue. Not all rules are good or useful or healthy. Being gay is no disqualification to be a good priest, regardless of any "rule". The fact is that many in the hierarchy are gay.  If the Church actually got rid of all of its gay clergy, we would be left with very few.
An unresponsive response. I asked you a question, RD. You say that duties come before rights. So what duties do LGBT people have that differ from the duties that I have as a heterosexual?
I proudly stand with the LGBTQ community. This recent attack, more than all the others, honestly hurt me all the way down to my soul. This attack was my tipping point, I have been so angry! Not sure how to handle all this rage energy, but I have been using my voice, and I will be using my Vote to hopefully change, what else can we do?
I love Fr. James Martin and know he means well with this suggestion. However, lots of Catholic churches have "outreaches" for LGBT people, their parents, or both that use the official intrinsically disordered line as their starting point and will not accept any other starting point, e.g., fine the way they are. Some even claim that they are best serving LGBT people by correcting their confusion. Who knows what wonderful things could occur if they parked the catechism and just got to know LGBT people as people? My fear is that the sensible priests have already done that and that those who hew to the official policy are not likely to see the whole person anyway. All they see is the "defect."   His comments about language are spot-on. His concerns about the firing LGBT people need to be heard far and wide.
Not so for all.  Mine is for one year.
ISIS and their followers like this terrorist all believe in giving the death penalty to all members of the LGBT community.   This is hardly the belief of a single man.   Their extremist Wahhabi Sunni version of Islam teaches such intolerance and hatred.   And there are many millions of Wahhabi followers in the world.   Did you miss all of the gay men that ISIS executed 6 months ago for sodomy?   They punished them by throwing them off the rooftop of a tall building:  http://www.news.com.au/world/islamic-state-group-targets-gays-with-brutal-public-killings/news-story/3b55d4e061e005aa8418ca2debc90e92

Not sure what survey the DA Assoc is referencing to support its self-serving claim that DAs "are in touch with their communities".   Also not sure how they are defining "communities";  the county where they were elected? The Black community?  The Latino community? Native Amercan community? Wealthy white Republicans? Recovering addict community? Communities of the formerly incarcerated and their families? Parole, Probation, Jail and Prison staff? Police and sheriffs?  Disabled community? GLBT community? Communities of people who raise chickens?  Collect rocks? Count birds? Local NRA chapters? Affiliated marijuana dispensaries? Water sports enthusiasts?  Christian fundamentalists? Bridge and Scrabble playing community?  Have only met one DA who represents any of the communities of which I'm a member. As a group they tend to be punitive and sanctimonious, routinely pursuing options which ravage lives rather than enable atonement, restore the community, or reflect true justice.
All the Subarus around town belong to lesbians? Way more of us than I thought.  Here's a news flash for you, mostignorant, lesbians can and do get pregnant. It's just not an "ooopsie!" that results in abortion.
Apparently there is considerable interest among NCR readers in the LBGT issue, but I don't know many people who think it is an important issue for the Church. Poverty, war, attacks on Christians in so many places in the world, secularization of Western society and the decline in Church participation are more than enough in importance to occupy the attention of concerned Catholics and of our Holy Father. The scandal which is given to the church by sexually active priests (gay or straight) is devastating, particularly when directed toward children, and clearly neither gay nor straight clergy have a monopoly in this field, but it is just undeniable that throughout the world (and the Church is everywhere) that the gay lifestyle is abhorrent to many. It is reasonable, since no one has a right to be a Catholic priest, to limit opportunities for scandal even where the means are not perfect.
This is a profoundly mistaken sentiment.   No one chooses their sexuality. It's inherent. Who would choose to be subjected to the torrent of hate that comes at the LGBT community? Similarly, even less does someone "choose" their gender identity. Have you seen what these kids go through as they make their transition? (of adults I have no direct experience) And you think they are doing this by choice? Oi.  It's very sad to read that people still harbour these kinds of beliefs. Religion is a choice. Politics is a choice. Neither gender identity or sexuality is a choice. It simply is.
I suggest you do that very thing. My home computer is a cheap laptop, and resides in Betverton, Oregon and not NE Portland. I find if hilarious that you cannot accept that a white woman and black man can be friends without having a sexual relationship. This confirms your overal mediocrity. So, yeah, check me out. You'll find that I post from my laptop and cellphone, niether of which have ever been in Fred's house. LMAO...:)
"I think folks who want to protest would do well to study their methods and adapt them to the circumstances."  I have told people this repeatedly--in fact, it's one of my favourite examples. However, a lot of people think LGBT rights just magically percolated into culture consciousness. They fail to understand the strategy. Of course, the movement was shaped from the outside by the HIV crisis, which is widely reputed to be a public relations turning point--think of Act Up and the AIDS Memorial Quilt--but then regrouped with marriage as the goal. Ironically, people on the right recognize this fact, whereas many on the left tend to regard LGBT rights as a natural extension of civil rights (I believe they are too) and think it just kinda evolved on its own accord. It's all about the vision that is being offered--it has to be positive and well-timed. The pro life movement is an example of a failed movement without vision.
Where is Joseph Swing   General RET,and Eisenhower when you really need them. 1954 operation"wetback" began in earnest and was a success. But with decades of open border farmers,and ranchers and crooked Democrats and crooked Republicans a sovereign nation has descended into chaos, drug infestation, illegal alien sanctuary cities, dead Americans presidential and AG gun running schemes, job loss, and undermining national security. Solution? Don't let any politicians stop the removal of the many law breakers. Give the Border Patrol an open license to use Harlon Carter tactics and get it done once an for all.
http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/16/princeton-player-becomes-only-openly-gay-player-in-college-football/  Given the title "princeton-player-becomes-only-openly-gay-player-in-college-football" I suspect not.
The government's actions seem to be addressing exactly that point, no need for Earth to Trudeau, he obviously understands that (or at least his minister's do and he has not contradicted them).
Reaching people where we are is an ongoing task of all preaching and public prayer.  It isn't necessary to produce full cosmological treatises, or to achieve something that feels perfectly right.  The Gospel upsets all relationships we have learned to accept.  So our prayer should shake and upset us and take us beyond our accepted categories, be they Ptolemaic or Newtonian or Einsteinian, to where Christ is.  Attempts like Daly's are a positive step because they remind us that what once served the church well becomes slowly inadequate.  But we still have to ratify the prayer with our Amen, and if only we did so in a growing awareness of what is at stake!
I personally don't want politics and a person's extremist religion  to make decisions for the city of Portland.  Keeping extremists out of politics is very important to me in my decisions when I vote.  Extremist religions are dangerous to our society because their is always hate and exclusion of others and that isn't a religion it's a "cult'.  I'm not a Roman Catholic, but as I recall the Pope said he didn't judge LGBTQ and encouraged their involvement in the church.  American Roman Catholics woman definitely use birth control and the Pope recently said as a reminder to families that 'we're not rabbits' referring large families. Rational people use their ability to think beyond magical thinking and indoctrination of religious 'cult' beliefs.
Les, Yes and public places...Gay night clubs, Schools, Company parties, Shopping malls. The list is endless. We are not safe. We need huge government expansion.
And have you reviewed the literature which reflects the increase in both  women and minorities in police work?  And the increase in numbers of college graduates in police work?    While your 'concern' is laudatory, your broad brush which paints all police as knuckle-dragging Neanderthals is biased, bigoted and seriously out of date.
True. Atrocities have been committed in the past under the banner of religion.  A judgment against the whole for the crimes of a few is not justifiable.
And I can actually imagine the people on the right jumping gleefully that they can now treat women, immigrants, LGBT, and poor with total disregard for humanity, respect and compassion. Break a leg during your show!
I hope these anti-LGBT ninnies do propose initiatives against law abiding community members.  And I look forward to our Superior Court and Supreme Court striking down the mindless initiatives.
many animal species- are we dogs? I have nothing against gay people but like Last Patroit pointed out, it is Christians and the Bible that are singled out and not muslims. I believe in letting God judge and not hating but often wonder about no words against the Quran.
Clearly you don't see the irony in your response, 420. I have no hurt feelings, just rational thought. As for educating me... laughable at best, 420. I ask for proof, you give me some "definition" you simply googled, 420. Where's the proof of the majority, 420? And how does your copy/paste definition relate to your statement, 420? How does it relate to transgender individuals using a restroom, 420? Why are you not outraged by gay, lesbian, queer, bi folks going into the restroom? the locker room? the showers even! Oh my! PANIC, 420!!! You lack proper debate skills.   How about I educate you instead: Ignorance (Noun) The lack of knowledge or information, unenlightenment,  lack of education, lack of intelligence, stupidity, foolishness, idiocy, incomprehension of, unawareness of, unconsciousness of, unfamiliarity with, inexperience with, lack of knowledge about, lack of information about; informal cluelessness about.  You see where I'm going with this right?
"And now we have the 'Last Generation Theology' ministry..."  Bill, For several times in the past the heresy of Perfectionism was pushed into the SDAC, by different agents. They never succeeded because the Church always expunged the false teaching quite quickly.  What we are witnessing now is the same heresy being presented under the disguise of a fancy name - LGT! It's bad that so many people appear unacquainted with the heresy and are not recognizing it in he LGTarian movement.  What is worse this time though is that there has been no word, absolutely none from the top administration to denounce this heresy. I am personally persuaded that Ted Wilson actually supports it; which means that this time the LGTarians (aka "perfectionists) were able to infiltrate the Church's barracks to the top of the administrative pyramid.  More than anything else, the LGT heresy is the biggest danger threatening our Church.
This a waste of our tax payer money right now and sorry to say is not the root of cancer dilemma here or america anymore. When I was a child there were ads on t.v with Joe camel and the Marlboro man. If you go back another twenty teachers were allowed to smoke in class. Smoking was the normal. Now there is no smoking  In schools and so forth dont smoke In cars with other people who dont smoke And so on. Smokers in general are much more few and far between then back then. Yet cancer rates and even diabetes rates have more than doubled? And they keep going up? Maybe look to the real culprits next time. Or even better spend that money on the real crisis in Alaska. Our prescription pill, Heroine and Meth population is going through the roof. Little known tid-bit for those who aren't In touch with society today. When you give someone presc. Pills and then take them off it later if they are addicted they will move right over to heroine. Thanks Doc! #WhyDontWeDoSomethingthatmatters!
LifeoftheLay, how often do you ask that very question of yourself?
So let me get this straight, so Hilary is for: Women's rights LGBT rights  Is this s correct assumption?  You can comment on the "Super Predator" scenario at your leisure.
Transgender athletes..... Transgender students.....  This is what feminism gets you in society.  This was unheard of only a short 20 years ago.
Ha ha.  Yes, perhaps a missed opportunity.  We used to refer to them as "water rats".   It's because we occasionally saw South Vietnamese army  soldiers alongside rice paddy irrigation canals, waiting for them to get flushed out so they could shoot them.  Needless to say, if our guys weren't anticipating the shots, they'd drop to the ground at the sounds, flicking safeties off their rifles at the same time, and pointing accordingly.  Somebody had to yell "hold fire!", just in case.  Google rat dishes, Mekong Delta, and you'll get a better description of those "delicacies".  Maybe they do taste like chicken.
keith_moon: "I just wait patiently until you go home" . This behaviour is contradicting your claim that people bypass, ignore and never mind. It's hard to believe what you said when you act in opposite.
Or they are very liberal and want to censor what really goes on or how many others really feel. Why would they delete the public from commenting on a very liberal article about a lbgt woman....person....? They are afraid of what many will say and do not want the rest of the public to see the comments.
"he asked LGBT Catholics to recognize the church hierarchy — the pope, bishops, priests — as teachers of the faith, though with differing levels of authority, and to whom all should listen and "prayerfully consider what they are teaching," even when you may disagree with their message, including on LGBT matters. " This message is difficult to swallow for many of us - straight or gay - as it sounds dangerously close to clericalism. While I have always listened with "prayful consideration" to the teachings (as early as first communion instruction), after prayful meditation I reached my own conclusions. I gleefully discovered that those conclusions were shared by many readers in this NCR community. The two-bridge proposal needs to go further. The hierachy should be open to listen to the teachings coming of our life experience - gay and straight. It is time for a more active participation of the laity.
Tell me the who penned the book of Romans and you'll realize you're wrong. It was Paul by the way, not God who said these things, whom also persecuted Jesus' ministry at first before beginning his righteous journey. There is a path from sin as God knows what's in your heart. So it is of no consequence what someone's sexuality is in my opinion.   In regard to the article: I think the point of this petition is to dually respect business owners' beliefs and not force them to participate. A Roman Catholic for instance, may find it difficult to abide this human law over their beliefs and that not should be the case. If they are more comfortable with sacrificing customers then so be it. It's not as if same-sex couples won't find someone to make a cake for them, or any other services they may be request of business'. Business' will suffer the revenue loss, while others who are accepting will flourish and we should let that equilibrium take place imho.
"Catholics in this county recognize civil LGBT marriage as an important civil matter."  Right.  Real Catholics follow Church teaching, and "recognize civil LGBT marriage as an important civil matter" that should be strongly opposed, as it against God's law.  .
Thank you Mark!  If I were you I wouldn't waste a breath on any of the wrong-winger naysayers comments.  None of them ever get tired of bashing Democrats, liberals, the homeless, the LGBT, Alaska Natives, or any other issue that makes their bigot or racists traits uncomfortable.  Have a great day, Mark.  True Alaskans still love and support you.
I believe this is such a generational issue.  Many under 60 have little to no issue with anyone of the LGBT community; for the older generations, in their youth, LGBT issues were  a taboo discussion, that they could believe they did not know anyone who was LGBT.  My nephews and nieces and  their children, 30's and younger think the idea that it is a problem for anyone who is LGBT to be denied any kind of job/career/vocation is just ridiculous.  Yes, we all know many wonderful gay priests.
Trump's "support" for Catholics is outlined on his website at: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/issues-of-importance-to-catholics .  Part of that is support for the "First Amendment Defense Act" which would legalize discrimination against LGBT and others based on religious grounds (similar to the act enacted and then repealed by his running-mate Pence in Indiana).    No thank you.
You can be fired for being LGBT.
So a woman or girl wanting privacy in the bathroom or a photographer not wanting to be forced to take pictures he doesn't want to take is discrimination? That is what the petition is about. Quit deceiving people. The petition is asking for protection from LGBT people forcing their lifestyle on others. You have the right to sin, but you do not have the right in this country to push your sin on others.
Just curious, but does anyone happen to know how the order of letters in LBGTQ was determined?
Useful information, thanks.  I didn't know Imago Dei, and thought it a local indie congregation.  Knowing it is a part of a "conservative Baptist" (repetitive, I believe--are there "liberal Baptist" churches?) makes Jules membership/participation all the more troubling, given the formal positions--on women and the LGBT community--taken by the larger Baptist denomination.  CBA's own position paper, June 30, 2015, regarding the Supreme Court ruling that same sex marriage is Constitutional, calls on Baptists to "mourn" for those who. living in sin, can't know Christ.  This exclusionary religious perspective (which has given us countless bloody wars for centuries)--believe what we do or you can't be saved--requires, again, that I ask:  "What the heck is Jules doing supporting this religious perspective?"  And if he doesn't, why can't he find a church more aligned with his core beliefs?  I hope we find out.
Unfortunately, as much as I disagree with Cathy on this, Justin Parish is not an option...  With his connections to the sexual deviant LGBT community in Juneau, he is really no better.
Could you clarify, something for me? If a person is born with a penis and testes, it is male, right? And if a person is born with a vagina and a uteris, it is female, correct? As far as I know, the physical attributes each human is born with is not a matter of choice. After birth, humans have many years to make a decision as to what their sexuality will be or even may be born understanding what their sexuality will be at sexual maturity. Some may even identify as being a different sex than at birth. I agree that there are perhaps lesser or greater variations of bi-sexuality that permeate all human beings to a lesser or greater extent. The exploration and discovery about ourselves continues and will be either exciting or dreaded, depending on your views and experiences.
In the first place,  male and female ex-felons, many of whom have violent, sexual criminal pasts, are today leading successful and productive  and meaningful  lives!  These ex-felons have fully paid the price, imposed by law, for their crimes. Many are voting, tax-paying and productive members of our society, yet they are persecuted and maligned and horribly stigmatized by the media, the courts, and especially, the organizations for victim justice!  This treatment of people with violent, sexual criminal pasts is, tragically and obviously clear,  a diversion perpetrated  by vindictive organizations, such as, VICTIMS FOR JUSTICE,  THE LGBTQ  AND  PLANNED PARENTHOOD,  just to name a few!  The people in these organizations are committed to unashamed sexual violence and perversion and murder of helpless, unborn babies, and our legislators and media KNOW IT!  Instead of complaining, because these people don't always get their way, they ought to be grateful they don't get what they deserve!
St. Ronnie was also a disaster for the mentally ill in California -- make that a continuing disaster.    According to an NBC news report, Trump and yuge family are enjoying this ONE Thanksgiving weekend to the tune of $20,000,000 in Secret Service protection -- (while those in his cabal are figuring out the quickest way to dismantle "entitlement programs" -- like those so many of us count on to actually LIVE -- Social Security, Medicare, Obamacare, Medicaid, SNAP -- which we have funded through  taxes our entire working lives).  The parenthetical comment was my own, not NBC's.
gay probably poor also otherwise he could of moved on her like a bitch and grabbed her by the pussy
Russia has been bombing hospitals in Syria. Russia has killed dissidents. Putin was a KGB agent. They've killed millions. They've banned free press. They abuse their LGBT people. They've hacked our country and others. But you're right. We should just stand back and let them do whatever they want because it isn't us. Those who stand for nothing, fall for everything. They came for the Jews but I wasn't Jewish........
No spin, overwhelmingly christians in this nation are the ones creating divisions between people and using their faith as a weapon in order to oppress minority groups they deem inferior. They rightly deserve the heap of blame, Prevo, Minnery and their ilk are the ones opposed to AO96 here in Anchorage and would like to see our LGBT friends and neighbors fired, evicted and denied economic services all because the wizards who interpret their magic spell book say they are bad. Religion may have served a useful purpose at some point in our past but has long since outlived its usefulness.
Why is it that people like you, Bradley, enjoy driving the race or bigot card every time an article is published about blacks, Alaska Natives, the homeless, or the LGBT?
I am pro LGBT and my husband is female to male transgender. I helped carry the 50ft flag on the parade. It is not brainwashing. It was my own choice a long time ago before I even met my husband that I would be an ally. I was raised in a strict anti-LGBT home and I grew up defying them and their ways. Hell they even hate that I am wiccan
Hillary's gay? Who'd a thunk.
I can give the Diocese of San Diego credit for not only recognizing "the elephant in the room" at the Synod on Marriage, but for realizing this issue MUST be faced by the church.  As Fr. John Dolan acknowledged, "Young adults have an acceptance of the LGBT experience.  It is simply a part of their world, and they look at us and say, "What is the problem?"   As I stated in another posting, unless these social and gender issues are not candidly discussed with young adults----the church in the West will be greatly diminished in less than two decades.
Yes, marriage is a civil contract administered by the government. However you can not dichotomize the government and the people because the people are the government, so the LGBT community is 100% correct in their assumption. I don't agree that anyone should be forced to participate in anything they don't want to as it is a violation of individual liberty. Nor do I agree that anyone has the right to deny another the right to marry as it is a violation of individual liberty.
Marty E: "science is irrelevant"  Peter Beacham: Of course, science is not irrelevant and the Church knows this. There is a battle for truth and supremacy between science and the church in certain areas. This bid for authority is why Catholicism has waged a long battle with science even murdering scientists, Giordano Bruno, for example, who shone truth on ridiculous church teachings, such the earth being the center of the universe. Now, science is again outing the church's smug ignorance in matters related to LGBT people. The Church can't kill these scientists but it can encourage the murder of LGBT people by its ignorant and vengeful pronouncements against them. The result is that people are leaving the church in droves. The smaller the church gets the more it snarls and fights with its back against the wall in a bid to save itself. Instead it could gain converts if it only looked realistically and dispassionately at the truths science presents. Scientific truth isn't contrary to God.
"How can he be a "hater" of LGBT and Immigrants and still go to a show that is so openly pro LGBT and immigrant?"  The CON was, tRump-Fence knew it was going to happen like this, all along. Staged just like tRump's fake publicist from years ago. What a better place to stage their con, than at a theatre.  Oh yeah, doesn't take a Ben Carson brain surgeon to figure out that a 70% Blue, Manhattan crowd would have this reaction.
The Gasping Old Party can't win because they have alienated the vast majority of women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians, Millennials, LGBTs, the poor - the list goes on.  And this continues despite the 'autopsy' the party big wigs held years back that concluded the Republican'ts must have a 'bigger tent.'  So much for that.   How shameful that Murkowski, Sullivan and Young are all in for Trump. That is proof positive that they don't listen to the people they are supposed to represent, and put party over all else.  They'll own that for years and years. Pathetic.
The contributions to a church are already taxed.  The church is a non-profit, the money goes to many things, including supporting the homeless and other groups, even LGBT people in need of help. Your hatred and contempt for Christianity will all too soon be replaced with your fear of Islam.  Muslims will be nice nice until they have the numbers and influence to rape and kill at will.  Europe is the harbinger of things to come.
"I wonder if the LGBT community could give the institutional church the gift of time. Time to get to know you..."  Seriously? I'm 73 years old and have been fighting for acceptance within the Catholic church my whole life. While there are small pockets of Catholic parishes that embrace LGBQT people, most are, at best, willing to include you if you remain silent and not push "a gay agenda". Few actively confront their local bishop to be more accepting.  To encourage the bishops to soften their tone is almost laughable. In 2016 they preach that I am "intrinsically disordered", not a far cry from the days when I was "intrinsically evil". Such terms are no less painful to hear. Such terms cause (some) non-gay Christians to hate them. The LGBQT community has a very long history of being persecuted by the Catholic hierarchy. Long before I will walk with them, they are going to have to actively seek forgiveness for their sins against the LGBQT community. Our wounds are deep. Our pain is real.
Not any more.  Catholics in this county recognize civil LGBT marriage as an important civil matter.  I suspect most would not be terribly upset if the magisterium found some way to recognize that (just as the sun does not circle the earth) LGBT people are as God made them and He loves all of their human-ness, including their sexuality.  LGBT people have a whole whale of a lot of other aspects to their personhood than their sexual orientation - there are some wonderful people out there who's "wonderfulness" is ignored because they are LGBT and seek to find a loving relationship just like any non-LGBT person.  Marriage was a civil contract for the first 1000 years of Christianity and the Catholic Church.  Maybe we should return to that earlier Tradition.
Well, some LGBT people bore children before they came out. Are you against adoption? Adoption has its pitfalls but it's probably better than being in foster care. Maybe you should check out the research on LGBT families by adoption because one of its editors is well-acquainted with the psychological risks of being adopted (Adoption by Lesbians and Gay Men: A New Dimension in Family Diversity, Brodzinsky and Pertman, Oxford University Press--Brodzinsky is the guy I was referring to).
"Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT."  And Catholics, too! As historian John McGreevy points out in his latest book, AMERICAN JESUITS AND THE WORLD (Princeton University Press, 2016): The Republican Party's anti-slavery program was coupled with an anti-Catholic one. The KKK targeted three groups, especially in the South: Blacks, Jews and Catholics. Can one forget Lyman Beecher's son, Edward, a well known educator and abolitionist, who, like his father, used to weekly sermon to warn his listeners of a Catholic conspiracy and one time even donated 4,000 dollars to fight "popery."  One of his anti-Catholic talks led to a crowd to burn down Boston's Ursuline Convent, with the local fire dept. refusing to respond to put out the fire.
I agree that the notion of compromising political, civil and human rights, especially of minority persons and communities, ought to make us very uncomfortable. I think with respect to GLBTQ persons, same-sex marriage, and related issues, the following principles should be honored: 1. No-one who disapproves of same same-sex marriage should be required to enter into one. 2. No-one should be required to accept an invitation to attend a same sex wedding, or any other wedding. 3. No minister should be required to officiate at a marriage that does not comport with the requirements of her or his faith community. 4. There must be no discrimination against GLBTQ persons in accessing services of government or business. A related issue: it’s probably time for ministers to cease functioning as agents of the state when they witness marriages.  The US Bishops have done a pretty thorough job of trashing the notion of religious liberty. It’s time to just stop.
Novel thought JD, thanks!  So Jules is a "stealth" candidate who is going to find common ground between those who condemn the LGBT community and believe women must be subservient...and those of us who believe we're all created equal and should be accepted/respected for WHO we are, not what we are.  Good luck to him, he's going to need it.  And if he pulls it off, I'll definitely reconsider my vote in 2020.
Do we have a summary by High School as to how many gay, lesbian, heterosexual, bi-sexual and transgendered students are graduating in our area this year?   Or how many are still in high school and will need to be appropriately supported?   If we are going to properly prepare our educational system for the future, we need to know the numbers so we can properly allocate resources based on need, rather than anecdotal stories such as this.
GLBT and the Bible is a whole different topic. But it's sad that you were burnt on it....  There is no book like our Bible.
Best opinion column in the ADN again this Sunday morning. Love this guys style, his wit, his intelligence and feel for the pulse of America. I see also that Charles Blows most excellent take down of trump is still up at the NYT this morning for the fifth day running. Hit a nerve with that column. So glad the ADN sees the value in the message of both of these opinion writers at a time when most mainstream/right wing media is calling for us to normalize trumps words and deeds towards his fellow Americans. Trumps behavior towards women, minorities and every demographic not white and male must never be forgotten or normalized. He has shown himself to be a sexist, misogynist, racist, bigoted pig and that is not what we need or have ever had in a POTUS. He campaigned on dividing America while Clinton's slogan was "Stronger Together" so Keillor's suggestion that we just go along with the orange cretins division theme seems wholly and sadly reality based.
GFNC55: Now that you and Tucker put a light on it, what should be the definition of "tolerance"? Should we allow LGBT their own lives and privacy or cite the bible to condemn their lifestyle? Should we tolerate condemning all Muslims for the crimes of a few? Should we tolerate constitutional dimwits occupying the Malhuer National Wildlife Refuge? Should we tolerate white nationalist hatred? How about Dakota Sioux protest over an oil pipeline?  Its messy. Tolerance is too vague and broad a word. Its a shortcut to claiming what's right and wrong. And who can claim authority over that?
I don’t get it.. he is just LGBTCM leave him alone
I see the Atheist has arrived on scene...
Sounds like typical liberal, resorting to name calling, if anyone is a bigot its you against Christians,  I'm not a Christian or a bigot, I do have several gay friends that are really embarrassed about gay pride parade and all of the fuss,  they don't want it and have a good life,  its the liberal agenda pushing it,  if you think anyone will change their minds by the government saying it will be so,  think again.
I can't believe your callous support for employment discrimination. From what shadowy corner of your psyche is this coming?  You're gloating at the prospect of ENDA's slipping beneath the political waves. Ever heard of compassion? Are your moral sensibilities so fragile that they'd shatter in face of equal rights for LGBT people?  I really don't understand the paranoia, and naked hostility, that LGBT people face daily in the States; there's more than enough of it in these comments.  Here, in the UK, you'd be taken to court and fined, heavily, for the kind of discrimination you're cheerleading. And you'd find few sympathizers, not to mention a largely hostile media.   Yeah, I know: what right have I, a Brit, to poke my nose into American politics? But come on, man: this isn't about geopolitical boundaries and international etiquette; it's about human welfare, the maximization of human happiness. No, not a take on Bentham's utilitarianism, but love of neighbour, bar none.
FWM:     "Springfield Alliance for Equality and Respect (SAfER) is a CALC program formed in 1997. SAfER is the only grassroots social justice group based in Springfield, and its leadership is provided by people who live in Springfield.  SAfER’s mission is to promote human rights, respond when abuses of human dignity occur, and urge public institutions to address social justice concerns. SAfER is committed to immigrant rights and racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and the right to shelter."  I don't see any reference to the organization being "communists."  Do you have any actual evidence of this claim?    Participants at the rally, it seems, did report the disruptive  from Mr. Marr's loudspeakers.  The SPD knocked on his door, I'm guessing, to ask him to either turn off or turn down his loudspeakers on his roof.  He refused to answer the door and, by so doing, declined any possible effort to resolve the issue with no legal action.    It's silly to attempt to make Mr. Marr  a victim.....
The green eyed monster doesn't care what the sea food chain is all about. All they care about is money, money, money.
Here we go again!  The RCC's obsession with a large constituency of its clergy, gay priests, is a never ending saga.  As a Colombian priest noted in his book, the RCC has been one huge closet for RC males who don't want to come out to their families.  This is certainly truer in culturally more repressive societies.  Fortunately, civilizing parents are embracing their offspring more affirmatively than the institutional church. The latter is a bad mother who continues to judge without mercy, reason. How 'bout priests a with bisexual orientation? Shouldn't Francis & Co. address this?  They deserve equally discriminatory time. If a priest capitulates to his sexual urges, there is always confession.  How long the RCC saw pedophile priests need only confession, not any secular law to get with the  program?  Why doesn't it warn pedophiles who see girls and boys as their prey from entering priesthood? Jimmy Breslin contends the decline of vocations is due to their cover being blown in the RCC.
But let's also be clear that there are plenty of faith groups that support LGBT.  It's not gay-vs-Christian, much as the Evangelicals and conservative Catholics want to make it, and we really should push back on that simplistic framing.  Also Remember  Catholic laity are amongst the most supportive of civil marriage equality.
wrong, while a juvy might not get life without parole, these kids are charged as adults therefore the juvy status is not brought into question
The violence and demonization, the implicit and sometimes explicit egging on of cruelty, discrimination, and bullying, is, as far as I can see, in one direction: from religions attacking LGBT people. This is another reason why the idea of a compromise on LGBT civil-rights issues violates ethical principles and ideals.
I don't think anyone is objecting to education funding. It's just that there isn't any inflation that would warrant an increase in the BSA for 2017.  Have to agree, a 1k bonus for teachers working in a district that is facing a multi million dollar deficit is not only stupid, it's an entitlement to boot!
Well there are plenty of women attracted to canidate Trump, so your comments are pretty damning toward those women.   You've insulted these women ergo you must be sexist.  I don't think you are of course!!  Just pointing out the double standard.   I may not like a woman's decision, or even understand it, but I'll stand with her freedom of choice?  Don't you trust women? Do you hate women?  Does this sound familiar?    You are right about Republicans laying claim to moralty issues but then ignoring the immorality of Trumps behavior.  Politics makes us all hypocrites at one time or another......    Let's go back to policy?
Special interest groups are only out for themselves. It seems like the LGBT community doesn't care about the legitimate choice that millions of their fellow Americans made on election day. Donald Trump was democratically elected, and those individuals playing victim cards can't see past their own grievances. Who's intolerant now?
That is an utterly ridiculous thing to say, since these poor people were specifically targeted because they were members of the LGBT community.  That would be like saying that Adolf Hitler targeted 6 million people for death in concentration camps in WWII, and failing to mention that they were Jews.
The fact that this man wAs a marine and one of the officers he killed was also a marine shows the falling of brotherhood within our military men/women.  I remember when serving your country was a calling and afterwards you regarded the men as your brothers.  "Even though nowadays people try to say capt America and buckey barns R gay because of how close they were, (morons that's called brotherhood because you fought and next to each man and that man covered your ass on the field)".   Now when people serve their country they seem to have forgotten what the core taught them, what they swore an oath to, what they are supposed to believe in.
"Therefore, I support gay marriage as a legal right but not as a personal freedom for believers (just as I don’t support believers who engage in sexual immorality, greed, racism, pride, etc…)"  Your homophobic words are above.  And your prose smacks of seminary school- so I don't believe you don't care about the subject.   "I believe a biblical stance on LBGT would have a similar impact to society."  Wrong.  Since people are born gay or straight, being prejudiced against them is no better than the Book of Mormon denying the priesthood to non-whites.  Why do you equate beer and sexual orientation? Was Matthew Shepard killed for drinking a Black Butte Porter?
Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery...did God make us to enjoy adultery even though He issued a commandment against it?  Such fuzzy thinking.
The Catholic faith is not the only Way. Maybe the Catholic Church is the problem with their doctrines and attitudes to women and LBGT? (But it seems we have covered this before)
Now, now, RD, don't go putting words into my mouth. Obviously the founding fathers believed in natural rights, which is why LGBTs should enjoy the same rights as everyone else.
He is more honest than the economic child molester Bill Walker is.
Like the 'walking dead' it doesn't seem how many Republican houses fall on Hillary's broom and pointy hat! The gender bender,Marxist -feminists and latter sipping hipsters rise from the political dead. The election is over....you lost....get a life outside of whining....grow up and let the rest of us get on living constructive lives unlike your trite selves!
the women of Poland do not have to fear losing the right to have an abortion. It will make them more mindful of the power of their sexuality and in the long run realize the blessing it is to be free of the abortion mentality. The world is going the way of Poland, be patient. This is a sign of Hope for everyone.
Already seeing homes that normally would be sold in less than a month sitting going on 6 months now in my neighborhood.
Amy, while the link between the killers and the medications they were on is uncertain, it is a weak analogy to compare these medications to water. Is there research showing that people who drink ordinary tap water become agitated, violent, or psychopathic? Not that I know of, but I do know there is some research showing that in a percentage of people, medications can cause those effects.  For example, as described in the article "Antidepressants Increase the Risk of Suicide and Violence at All Ages" by Peter Gøtzsche, MD.  https://www.madinamerica.com/2016/11/antidepressants-increase-risk-suicide-violence-ages/
You wouldn't be here if Alaska Natives hadn't sold (on the cheap) some of their birthrights for financial and government service protections.. You really could use some education or some social awareness or Christianity.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! "Let us resolve that if they come for any of us — Muslims, Hispanics, blacks, gays, women, geeks (like me) — they may as well come for all of us." What does that even mean? Damn, these freakin people are coming unglued.
Senator Ellis....Johnny....my friend. I had the distinct honor of working as one of your staff for four years in the Legislature.  Then there are the fond memories of singing together as "Bear-A-Tones" at Bartlett High School; I was happiest when we were paired up together.  Ah...Those were the days!  However, I have never been more  proud of you than I am right now! Being gay is not who you are, Johnny, it's what you are.  Who you are shines brightly in the 29 years of tireless public service you have given to Alaska.  Who you are is a true champion for children, the disenfranchised and the elderly.  Who you are is a man who truly loves Alaska and it's people. Who you are is a man greatly respected by his peers, constituency and friends.  Even though you won't be serving in the Senate anymore, your legacy will long be felt in those hallowed halls.  It took courage to share your personal story with us, but that just makes me love and respect you all the more.
I get the personal connection between Fidel Castro and the Trudeau family.  However, I think the official Canadian response should have been much more deliberate in it's condemnation of  the regimes past and oppression of political descent. I don't buy the relativism that some in this comment section that say he was not as bad as some of his contemporaries. That's like saying Mussolini was not so bad because Hitler was worst. Arguably Hitler was not even the worst of his time either. We forget that 20 million people in the Ukraine died under Stalin during the Soviet reign. Castro was a brutal dictator - all stop... And for that the Canadian government, the people of Canada and the world should judge him harshly for that. Yes - his regime created health care and education for the masses but it was selective racially. Blacks in Cuba did not get the same as white. Let's not talk about the brutal treatment of the LGBTQ population or any political descent. He was a monster...
I'm so sick of self righteous religious BS.  How is any kind of LGBT activity hurting you or your lifestyle?
These are people, not homosexuals, and you are an idiot, and no man of god. Leave this beautiful community of LBGQT alone and go far away, you are not welcome in my home state if this is how you are going to behave, you uneducated savage.
"In his role, Boissonnault will explore the possibility of an apology to LGBTQ2 people"  Well, it has been a week or so since Canada apologized for something to someone. I  was beginning to think Junior had lost his touch for sucking up for votes. The Trudeau government is rapidly heading for a crisis. The list of special interest groups left to apologize to is shrinking fast. Perhaps, next is the vertically challenged Canadians who have been made the butt of jokes because of their height. There has to be some compensation available there.  Maybe they should apologize to the Canadian taxpayers who get bent over the table every day by the government?
Hmm.  Let's see now.  The roots of Thai governance goes back nearly 1000 years.  It has provided stable governance in times of Chinese, Japanese, communist, and jihadist, intrusions and now an internal dispute between democratic political parties incapable of bipartisanship.  For the most part, the Thai government has been a rock of stability during these trying times throughout the ages, and yet, Dion is concerned about an internal issue of Thailand that it is more than capable of dealing with.  Yet another example of thoughtless, incorrect, lack of intelligent decision making from Trudeau's weakest minister.  He has bungled every issue that has come to his attention.  One could suspect he is following a strategy of not interfering in what he regards as the communist Chinese government's sphere of influence.
Listening is always good and helpful.  However, as long as the Catholic  hierarchy insists that the physical ways gay men and lesbians love their partners is serious sin, dialogue can only go so far.  As long as  LGBT  persons are regarded as disordered and regularly committing so-called "mortal sins" that, according to official Church teaching, will condemn them to hell, how in the world can they feel worthwhile and worthy and lovable within the institution?  They cannot. Under all the welcoming words and compassionate glances and the like,  the message is clear: you are living against nature and the will of God.  An off-hand comment, "Who am I to judge?," means little if nothing changes in the official teaching of the Church.
Check out his father and his history.  Convicted felon.  Fits right in.
Why can't nonreligious people fire religious people for their chosen religion and lifestyle too?   Why can't a Jew fire Christians or Muslims for their chosen lifestyles? Why is it only okay to single out the gay lifestyle for discrimination?   I know people who wont shut up about their religion and I tolerate them.    Yet they think they dont have to tolerate anyone else.  I know how gay people feel about having religion shoved in their faces...and I don't side with religious fundamentalists who make their religion someone else's problem.     The gay people I know don't do that.   They might mention their lesbian wife ("Susie and I went hiking at Hatcher's Pass last week...") or their gay boyfriend ("Rick and I are flying to Seattle tomorrow...) in passing etc.   They NEVER mention their bedroom escapades, and I don't care what they do either. Otherwise it isn't even a topic for discussion.   Minnery's folk never stop talking about gay people all day long.   There's a huge difference.
This post by you is most gratuitously offensive.   There is no good reason at all for you to involve lesbians in this subject matter.   You are way out on a limb here.  For you to do this clearly reveals you to be a bigot.
Obomba, don't care what others think, remove it. The LGB (minus the Q who are now not part of the click) don't want to to go into other genders locker rooms. The LGB use locker rooms based on science. The T are trying suck them into this mental disorder and they should fight getting sucked in not join in. The libs try and call this a "Bathroom" issue, no it is more a locker room issue and but the media won't mention young ladies being exposed to things they should not be or scared their safety is being imposed on. Instead this numb nut thinks we should all comply or else. My opinion that will be purged is that Augie Smith should take a bath with a toaster.
Monte, you said, "... There is no prohibition in the Bible of equality in ordination for both men and women, all races and ethnicities, all kinds of people."  What did you mean by "all kinds of people"? You'd already mentioned gender, race, and ethnicity. Is "all kinds of people" merely repetitive, or do they refer to people who are practicing homosexual, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender lifestyles?  Do you think there is anything in the Bible that prohibits the ordination of those who are practicing such lifestyles?
And since Newman, the doctrine of the development of doctrine has developed. ;-}  Tridentinus, we both know full well, perhaps more than some on this forum, this is the fundamental issue that divides conservative and progressives at depth. I suspect I may soon have to withdraw from NCR for while, so I dare not get into a serious discussion with you on this core issue just now.   Somewhat light heartedly, then, may I suggest if we could place ourselves intellectually back at the end of the 3rd century, prior to the christological and trinitarian councils, and have only scripture as our guide, a hundred competent Christian intellectuals are NOT likely to have come to the same conclusions as those great councils. Numerous views would emerge in our study  of scripture and many would have been heretical by today's standards.  I suggest the guidance of the Spirit was required to lead us beyond the tradition as then perceived to something genuinely new and marvellous, literally beyond words.
All I can say is,don't venture into a LGBT bathroom at a rest area on Interstate 5 going through Cali,unless you want to witness firsthand the real reason why any long,cylindrical object like a Walrus Tusk is strictly prohibited..
Why does it have to be bisexual men and prostitutes? How about an IV drug using prostitute and her married john, then his wife and her male lover and then his wife and her male lover?
Could you cite some evidence or links to support your view that only anatomy, physiology and immunology are genuine sciences and that they support the homophobia of the Catholic Church?
Sorry, I assumed you had an education and read the article.  I also assume you knew about the LGBT group suing the OR bakery for refusing to make them a cake.  Just like Bruce Springsteen refusing to perform in his concert in NC after the tickets were sold, can we now sue him and the LGBT group for discriminating against NC?  The crux of this bill is to stop suits against people exercising their right to refuse service in a business.
If one's attraction, in-born, leads one to find a love of a lifetime, straight, gay, lesbian, bi-, in that sense, could it not be said to be gift (of God)?  I agree generalization might be inaccurate on debernardo's part, but forgivable.  I agree we must ourselves raise our relationships (love, friendship, work, play, helping, service, group) to a sacramental level if those involved agree.  We don't need official priesthood to do this.  Done by intention and good faith.
Did you see trump proposed jailing or stripping of their citizenship those who burn an American flag?  Did you see that trump's attorney general and secretary of health picks both support removal of protections under the law for LGBT folks? That's just two examples of trump creating fear amongst rational people.  As far as offending the delicate sensibilities of trump's snowflakes, they should be ashamed of themselves.
The participation and complicity of many religions in encouraging the bullying, discrimination, and even violence against LGBT people in our society is very telling. This is a revealing moment, isn't it, for these institutional religions?
Ok what? Enlighten us? You are missing the point how could those parents have prevented this? My parents are not the Cleavers but they were not absent parent out getting wasted on welfare no drugs, no domestic violence, they had jobs, my brother went to school. It seems so many are looking for someone to blame and or make these kids monsters. The truth is they're not, they simply gave way to their dark side, it is part of the duality of humans. Whether they do 10 years or 50 there life is over , prison is like war, it breaks people inside and out.  You wan to hear about fail is the two different girls who killed someone with their car and got less than two years. I suspect these boys will get more.
Here's a compromise suggestion. Stop shifting the blame for homophobia on to governments and other religions and acknowledge the central role of the Catholic Church in creating homophobia with its centuries long discrimination against and condemnation of the LGBT community, including burning LGBT people alive. Then eliminate the homophobic comments in the Catechism. Remember the Church has a long history of being on the wrong side of scientific findings. Time to wake up.
(2/3 part post) - the last part is further down the page  Back then circumcision was the surface issue, but the Council saw it fundamentally as a gospel issue. And the gospel was about fulfilment of the Law in Jesus. And if you understand Jesus; love for one another.  If a person was circumcised or not didn't matter, so those who wanted to carry on the practice could, and those who wouldn't find it significant to their faith were not required to.  One can expect that there were many from the law end of faith expression who wouldn't appreciate such freedom. After all wasn't circumcision an eternal sign between God and his people? And who has the right to tamper with Gods law!? . . . I'm sure some continued to persecute the free.  Interesting too that the Council asked the Gentiles to not eat food sacrificed to idols, yet a reading of Paul indicates that even this wasn't a blanket rule. He was happy to eat food sacrificed to idols just so long as it didn't offend someone weak in faith.
Kayden, religion has nothing to do with this. Hinduphobia- no it's cult and self seeking power hungry crooks like your man Butler that jump on the religious wagon who have no qualms about lying and cheating their way up the political ladder.  In Tulsi Gabbard's case, her guru has taken advantage of her cult beliefs she was born into and abused the fact that she is beholden to him. As he says when he initiates his disciples, you are now mine and I will instruct you how you can serve ME. Fanaticism not religion.  Cry yourself silly with all your talk on religious bigotry, homophobic backed support, Hillary Clinton money, and whatever else you can lash out with.  How about all the other religions, I don't see Tulsi and Butler supporting them. In fact she down right degrades the Muslims. Butler has always spoken very unkindly of Gays, Blacks, Muslims Christians and Jews.  Beware Hawaii, Tulsi and anyone who adheres to him, has no place in our democratic system.
Ken Alaska.    The Average Joe will cooperate fully and pay his ticket mostly without incident.  These DV deadbeats might be armed and dangerous to apprehend.  How much fun is that for the cops?  The DV deadbeats will never pay a fine instead choosing to spend very little time in jail only to be released to start the cycle all over again. It is simply not economically viable for law enforcement to choose to chase bad guys over ticketing Average Joe.
These safe injection sites should reflect diversity. Specialized sections need to be allocated to each gender identified individual in the LGBTQQS2 spectrum with supervisory personnel who have been sensitivity trained. This is incredibly important so as to eliminate conflict, violence due to triggered events.
It is possible to hold a specific belief personally but not endorse it corporately just FYI.  For instance, I personally believe God intended for men and women to marry heterosexually, I also believe in respecting people who don't share this belief and not using my personal faith to restrict equality for others.  Therefore, I support gay marriage as a legal right but not as a personal freedom for believers (just as I don't support believers who engage in sexual immorality, greed, racism, pride, etc...)  Just as God gives us the freedom to choose to follow him, His followers should extend the same grace and freedom to others to choose their own beliefs (so long as it doesn't restrict or oppress others).
If you think LGBT people are not vulnerable to abuse or often treated as outcasts, you're missing facts occurring in your own neighborhood.
Yes, we have covered this before. I would like to add the following: The Church's attitude to women is a problem for anybody who feels women are equal to men. I think Jesus Christ was a feminist and continues to be.  LGBT may be a seen as a sin to the Church, but it is for many in their community not a choice but a gift of God. In other words, not a sin.
How about the fact that many in the Muslim and Arab world hated us long before either of the Bush's were president.  I think it has to do with two things.  One is the fact that we support Israel.  The other would be that in the past we have represented ourselves as a Christian nation.  Both of those cause problems for some Muslims.

Ah Lesia, when one considers Churches with a married clergy, of course the proportion goes up among celibate clergy, But lets not forget that the proportion of married to celibate priests varies greatly over time and geography in our Church.   I was only recently converted to about 50% as a reasonable guess for the Roman Church. I certainly think it is increasing over time.   But I think "those who are insisting that gay men may not become priests" is a null set! Although the words could be given that sense, one would be very hard pressed to find a single bishop who is going to systematically deny ordination to gay men.
I don't get it.. he is just LGBTCM leave him alone.
Muslims hate gays and want them dead. Islam is the biggest threat to the LGBT folks on this planet. This is probably only the beginning of this sort of thing.
Jay Edward -  why should the Pope meet with the likes of C. Burke?  It wouldn't make one iota of difference because Burkie has an agenda to undermine the Pope and he would do everything possible to spin whatever response was given into a negative. Trust me!
actually, for clarification Mark, Prof Peterson was accused by Prof Bryson of propagating hate against members of the LGBTQ community..not committing a hate crime,, which is specific under the law, ...and of being completely similar to Professor Philippe Rushton, ...as well, she demanded that the U of T issue an apology to those who had suffered because of Prof Peterson's actions....which were to not use words which don't exist...,
Anyone who challenges the creed of the liberal-progressive ideology is a member of a "hate group". There's just no tolerance for "heresy".   The Center for Family and Human Rights is a research institute/think tank, founded to monitor and affect the policy debate at the United Nations and other international institutions. Referring to human dignity and a conventional understanding of related law and national sovereignty, it describes its mission as "to defend life and family at international institutions and to publicise the debate". A core value is "Fidelity to the teachings of the Church".  The Southern Poverty Law Center designated C-Fam an anti-LGBT hate group, characterising the institute as being "heavily focused on global anti-LGBT work", citing its opposition to United Nations efforts to protect LGBT rights.   Presumably, the Catholic Church herself is a "hate group".
"LGBT advocates express frustration over Vatican document barring gay priests."  Well, yes, they would, wouldn't they.
Ben nothing you wrote there about Kirk is illegal or unethical which are the calling cards of republican values along with them being anti-woman, anti-poor, anti-LGBT, anti-middle class, ect..... That is what you are supporting by supporting Republican Charles Djou. You really should read his party's platform and then read our party's platform and see the stark contrast.  If you are against the historic home exemption then why have I NEVER seen or heard of you speak out against it except when talking about Kirk. So it sounds like you are just anti-Kirk and use any red herring.   Your line "he somehow managed..." is a sad and pathetic attempt to try and sling mud at Kirk. That is NO WAY for a former Governor to act - you should be ashamed of this. I would hope you would lift the conversation but time and time again I and many others are disappointed by your behavior on-line and in the real world.
The vigorous bigotry towards Christians is pretty intense, but not surprising. The Jesus you're all talking about also said his followers would be persecuted and ostracized for their beliefs. So there's that... The miltant LGBT crowd and defenders of their "preferential rights" are swimming in an ocean of cash and great lawyers. You have nothing to worry about people. The Christians are going to lose, every time.
You embody this: "In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, the news is flooded with reports of abuse, assault, and harassment, largely of minorities, by jubilant Trump supporters celebrating the ascent of their candidate, a candidate who campaigned by appealing to white heterosexual Christian supremacy.  Over the past 48 hours, women have been assaulted for wearing the hijab, property has been defaced with swastikas, LGBT Americans have been threatened, and African Americans have experienced election result-specific harassment by fellow Americans touting the election of Donald Trump as the dawn of a new America, apparently one where they consider that the ugliest of racial and social animus to have the seal of presidential approval."  Why hasn't Trump denounced this behavior? For that matter, why haven't his supporters? Oh, right: They're the ines doing it.
You must want to know:  "Gay and bisexual menbare the population most affected by HIV. In 2014: Gay and bisexual men accounted for an estimated 83% (29,418) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses.  Black/African Americanc gay and bisexual men accounted for the largest number of estimated HIV diagnoses (11,201), followed by white gay and bisexual men (9,008).  Among all gay and bisexual men, trends have varied by race and over time. From 2005 to 2014:  Among white gay and bisexual men, diagnoses dropped steadily, declining 18% overall. Among Hispanic/Latinod gay and bisexual men, diagnoses rose by 24%. Although diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22%, they have leveled off in the past 5 years, increasing less than 1% since 2010. Young African American gay and bisexual men (aged 13 to 24) experienced an 87% increase in diagnoses. But since 2010, diagnoses have declined 2%."  https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/statistics/index.ht
Mucky wants a gay parade at every meeting in the country, eh,Muck?
Surely one of the most hideous statements to come from the Vatican in the post-Vatican II era.  Obviously it should be withdrawn and if Pope Francis is serious about apologizing to GLBTQ persons and their families for anything, surely the church must apologize for this.
I will miss Gabe and the show he was straight foward and a good man his dad and family should be very proud he will be missed from people he did not know but touched  let Jesus make a angel and i am so sorry for your loss he will be missed
And if by some stroke of fate Trump is removed from office during his term, it will be even worse for all minorities...  the undocumented, LGBT folks, persons of color, Muslims, anyone that isn't white or "Christian" and conservative.   Oh and the poor, they hate them too.   Even though most of the ones voting for them fit into that category.
They don't like our liberties either Einstein, including everything from your LGBT lifestyle to religius freedom.
Where should we start?  The moderator Anderson Cooper, who is in the Hillary camp, is a queer engaging in fisting, tea bagging and anal sex.  Hillary is bi-sexual and has a lover who is a Muslim and married to Anthony Weiner (enuf said).  It appears that Trump was having consensual sex with Ms. Universe contestants while Billy Boy was dragging one hundred dollar bills through trailer courts in Arkansas when he was not raping women.  On top of that Hillary has said in both debates that when they go low we go high.  Hillary is the one throwing all the dirt just how low can she go while saying she is going high.  When demonrats have sex they make their guys rock stars.  However when republicans have consensual sex with Miss Universe contestants that is some how naughty.  Additionally Trump has not left any of his lovers in his car at the bottom of a river ala Ted Kennedy.
I respect those who fear these changes -it is a departure from the black and white, right vs. wrong that was fundamental in many people's upbringing.  As more LGBT people are coming out, those who were once taught these people were "sinners" realize these people are not predators coming to indoctrinate children, but instead as neighbors and co-workers trying to make the best life they can in a discriminating society.  Life is more "grey" now, and folks are teaching their children to be careful around are those who fight a bit "too" hard against equal rights, who are often found to be fighting their own inner demons.
Stay on this site long enough, Lewis, and you'll get a clear picture that Craig is a racist.  S(he) trolls this site to post bigot or racists comments against the homeless, Natives, and the LGBT populations.
This new format to get through "politically correct" narratives makes me think ADN has some form of caste system going on here. I get a green face because I am a good boy and answer the stupid questions correctly. On the other hand, my friend Eddie Burke has a purple face and Jon Corbett is way down the pecking order with a red face. I think there should be a rainbow face too so we can be politically correct on LGBT issues!! WE ARE POSITIVE
Wow, you really are quite prejudiced, to continue to say such false and demeaning things about the LGBT community.   Take a look:  http://tinyurl.com/gup7bkm

I suspect the taxi driver was in cahoots with the robbers.
It's more than teaching boys to respect girls' bodies. They don't even know what that means. Affirmative consent should be taught in schools. Annual sex Ed, age appropriate k-12 should be mandatory.
Too often this is a life or death matter for gay teens.  Last I checked the suicide and homelessness rate for religious teens wasn't even close to the same numbers for as it for gay teens.  When that much pain is involved in an issue, compromise with the forces causing the pain is more akin to betrayal than anything else.   However, I doubt the LGBTQ community is going to isolate itself as a special case from other communities which will come under attack during the Trump administration.  There will be a coalescing of groups who join together to protect everyone's rights....even Islamic religious rights.  The gay community is in some respects uniquely positioned to provide leadership in this joint effort.  This is now a time to stick together, not necessarily stick out.
Of course not. Once again Mr. Rhyner is proving himself to be a di©k where LGBT equality are concerned.
Unfortunately most of this Progressive "change" does not seem beneficial to society.  Example: At my children's (1 and 3) daycare they are learning about homosexuality, transgenderism, and the importance of the LGBT community before they are taught anything about heterosexuality or the nuclear family.  Why you ask?  Because the manager of the daycare is in the LGBT community.    This is how it works.  One person with power inflicts their philosophy on young children under the guise of "inclusiveness," while at the same time not being "accepting" of the parent's philosophies.  Later on these same people lecture you on "acceptance."  Pitiful, I know.  But this is considered progress to some Americans.
I-Pi, I assume that Neighbor99 is someone connected to the church or Jules Bailey and that they signed up just to convince me that the LGBT community can feel safe with a man who attends and supports a church that is anti-gay and misogynistic.   We have accused each other of intellectual dishonesty- but that doesn't translate to dishonest acts.  I am sure you wouldn't steal my paper, and I would never clip your flowers.  BTW- I believe that some issues have gray areas- but reject the kind of "moral relativism" that allows for people to say that some patriarchy, some denial of civil rights to gays- is okay when sprinkled with pretty words.  It ain't.
The PC media needs to stop protecting the gay community from criticism.  To any open-minded observer, the gay male life-choice is unnatural and unhealthy, and has created a national health crisis.  In 2015, 81.7% of the reported male syphilis cases where sex of sex partner was known were among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  Available surveillance data indicate that an average of half of MSM who have syphilis are also infected with HIV.  Smokers get nailed to the cross constantly for irresponsible choices..... why not gay males?
Further light is shed on this at the Catholic Education Resource Center website where the hilariously titled "Serving LGBT Students in Catholic Schools" makes it clear that science simply isn't relevant. Transgenderism is described as "willful gender confusion" that Catholic schools must never tolerate. It is recommended that schools stick rigorously to the Catholic line--no exceptions allowed--as the . . . wait for it: best protection against litigation. This is clearly what is on the minds of those who gave us these guidelines, not the psychological or physical health of transgendered students.   http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/other-topics/serving-lgbt-students-in-catholic-schools.html
Not sure homophobia is a good way to describe something I have such an outwardly indifferent attitude towards.  Is the human species intended to pair heterosexually?  In my opinion yes, and I believe God had this intention.  Is the infrequent diversion from this norm bad in and of itself?  F**k if I know!   The bible does reference it very little and I realize my posts seem very cut and dry.  Beyond the above reasoning I can't say or argue definitively what the role of monogamous homosexual relationships are within the church or what Gods view on them are.  That's why it's just my opinion, not some fact I'm going to use in manipulating others.  I think you are doing a disservice by equating disagreement with intolerance.    If I rarely drank your favorite kind of beer would you call me intolerant toward your preference? No, we would say "huh, we like different things in a way that literally affects nothing".  I believe a biblical stance on LBGT would have a similar impact to society.

@frankthetank622 ive said it to twice today germany should not be here the jews should have been given it then would we see any of this now
so the jews are responsible for evil in this world: homosexuality, atheism, isis, you name it. good to know i'm part of the conspiracy.
@voxsartoria "just as the jews could not wait for the bread to rise,it seems these poor souls had to leave their winter clothes in storage."
@declanjoness i'm drifting in and out its annoying but i'm as motivated as hitler was with the jews at the minute so that's good.👀
@farzadforpeace haha it's all good. it's just that not all who care about the jews in holocaust care about the palestinians as they should.
@bluebelly1863 well...i havent......but i dont recall in the annals of history the jews every being super cheerful about stuff smh

israel has shamed their god! that is a sad thing for every one! for god punished the jews once before as they worship other god's an unclean idols! trump is about as sinful of a man as you get! an israel should not be honoring such a man on god's given holy lands! sad day indeed!
@peaceforeast the exodus story most probably is a garbled transmission of when the jews were slaves in babylon (an event we know did happen)

@jansant insane & inhumane. did we do this to the jews after wwii? or the vietnamese after 1975?

So how long is your "long time"? You obviously weren't around in the 50's. Joe McCarthy was a Republican. Black men were hung just for looking at a white woman.  Perhaps you should educate yourself a bit more.  Feel the Bern!
I understand your concerns but in abstract thought what your saying is ludicrous. There are so many issues in the world today, big issues that need addressing that telling others what they should and should not be doing on that flight that they paid good money for comes off as "hen pecking." Don't you think it would be better to say... Blacklist sex offenders or something? Otherwise your impeding on the rights of a lot, A Lot of innocent people in the name of "safety" which is irksome to begin with. Personally, I wish I could say what I'd like to see happen to the man who Yes, sexually assaulted that young girl but I'd be tossed off the comments section.
This was either a sick joke or a warning. Black Bears look very much like a human body. I have many slides of them in my Gruesome Files. Somebody was sending a message, thought it was a funny prank, or is just incredibly and completely insane.
Contemporary anti-discrimination laws have reduced themselves to absurdity.  In the 1960s, national legislation against racial discrimination "affecting interstate commerce" made sense, because racial equality was an issue forced upon the nation by history and numbers (about 12% of the population was black), and one which affected the well-being and future of the United States in numerous practical ways.  From that common-sense beginning, we've arrived at quarreling at the level of townships about laws governing the use of bathrooms by perhaps 0.1% of the population.  What's next, Christian bathrooms for those who don't want to pee next to Muslims?  Asexual bathrooms for those who don't want to be gender stereotyped by a sign on a door?  Vegan bathrooms for those who object that meat-eater poop stinks so bad?
I learned long ago that insisting upon, asking for an apology is a complete and total waste of time. It changes nothing and, the one to whom the request is made laughs at the petitioner. This carpetbagger is just like the white cops who beat on black human beings, they ENJOY it and, when asked for an apology, they laugh. Do not attempt to assign human feelings to them as, they are a life form or two below us.
"so this was a case where the black guy got himself shot"  Ah, so it's entirely the innocent (black) victim's fault that he's dead.  Just an accident.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.
Disagreeing with Elvi Gray-Jackson does not make you a "racist".  When I first saw her comments in the ADN I didn't agree with her and I have clue or care what race she was.  When I first saw her picture my first thought wasn't that she was black, it was that she looked like the Joker.
A ticket maybe ----but sure as heck not charged with murder.  When has any adult been charged with murder because their passenger wasn't wearing a seat belt ?  I wasn't in the courtroom and I assume you weren't either .  The judge was and heard all the evidence . It clearly shows this guy wasn't given a rough ride----and in fact it appears he stood up and bounced himself around inside the back of the van.  This , in my opinion , was a simple case of a black prosecutor showboating for blacks across America--by talking tough when she had to know she had no facts to back up her charges.  The only victims in this case are the poor police who have had their reputations and lives changed forever because of the bogus charges .  I hope they all personally sue the prosecutor .
Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.  How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Matthew 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Matthew 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print  The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.  I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.
Nuance black and white choices?  Thank you for today's oxymoron.
Like Trumps idea of raising the minimum wage to $15.00 Nationwide, love those Pistol Packing Republicans, coming soon to the U.S. $20.  "I nebber see such a sight," said Harriet; "we laughed, an' laughed, an' laughed. Here you'd see a woman wid a pail on her head, rice a smokin' in it jus' as she'd taken it from de fire, young one hangin' on behind, one han' roun' her forehead to hold on, 'tother han' diggin' into de rice-pot, eatin' wid all its might; hold of her dress two or three more; down her back a bag wid a pig in it. One woman brought two pigs, a white one an' a black one; we took 'em all on board; named de white pig Beauregard, and de black pig Jeff Davis. Sometimes de women would come wid twins hangin' roun' der necks; 'pears like I nebber see so many twins in my life; bags on der shoulders, baskets on der heads, and young ones taggin' behin', all loaded; pigs squealin', chickens screamin', young ones squallin'." Harriet Tubman(R) Another Grand Old Party Classic.
Because people are upset about situations the liberals have put us in.   It is the same way at "black lives matter" rallies.  I dare you to go to a "black lives matter" rally with something that says "All lives matter".
i hate racism. i think it is obscene.  i think i t goes both ways.  that said -  there is a line crossed when it's people who are police that are targeted .  they are the people who DO put their lives on the line for the public.  the service the police provide the public  is by no means done fairly, equally, honorably, unbiased, without ulterior motives, altruistically, etc, etc.  some cops , on-duty cops,  exhibit every evil that exists in the world.   they are relative to the total, but a small number of cops  are just bad, some real bad - had one in the family.  but, as a job,  these ARE the people who show up when most others would run.  they DO protect.  they DO save lives.  targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i'll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or  any person. eye for  an eye? not the answer.
Olds Soul says he sees Dixie in Springfield a lot and equates that with racism.  I see black people in Springfield and equate that with improvement.  His glass is half-empty, mine is half full.     Since I had a great uncle from Missouri on each side of the War of Southern Secession or the Civil War, (depending on which uncle you talked to)  and neither of them gave a rip about slavery one way or another, I do not equate that flag with racism.  My personal experiences with black people has all been in the military with the exception of one boss I had working for the State of Oregon.  I've had black superiors and black subordinates and black equals.  None of them achieved sainthood or were demons.  Some were incompetent, some were exemplary.  Most were somewhere in between.    Some earned their rank; some were given extra rank as 'affirmative action'.   When the rubber really meets the road, the losers get lost, no matter what their color.
I think it's unfortunate when people castigate an entire ethnic group due to the actions of a few deranged individuals. Hate and murderous intent not the exclusive province of any single community. Blacks as a whole are not responsible for the Dallas shootings anymore than whites are responsible for the Charleston church shootings. As Americans we should realize that we all share a common enemy: deranged individuals with easy access to weapons.
My apologies to Mr. Milbank: these gender-neutral "Christian" names have become a bugaboo!  Bernie just failed to "get" the anger of young blacks; he was extremely insensitive to several groups' call for his active support, i.e. Black Lives Matter. I was at the first Portland Bernie rally and the black folks were very angry at him for what they felt was his ignoring of their issues. What an irony! Bernie's been fighting for African-Americans for decades, far more actively than either Clinton (Bill's workfare reforms hurt mainly poor A-As), yet he was tone-deaf on that critical factor. It may be a little too late for him to make up ground now, Spike Lee's endorsement aside.
That's the beauty of the English language. Unlike Mr. Trump, there are nuances in most every point of view. Not everything has to be absolutely black or white.
NIGGER
Sadly, this is a common claim by people that just want free reign to kill, no originality, no thought or knowledge behind it.  But that's to be expected from back woods yahoos.
In other news today.  Per the Washington Post.    "Despite Black Lives Matter, young black Americans aren’t voting in higher numbers."   "Across two dozen states where exit polls were conducted in 2008 and this year, black voters over age 45 grew from 12 percent of the electorate on average in 2008 to 16 percent this year. In those same states, black voters under age 45 made up 11 percent of voters in 2008 versus 10 percent this year."  Hillary has to do something to get Bernie's young voters of whatever color or it is going to be an ugly November.    She has the old folks, white, black and Hispanic.  They vote more often, but....
I hope they discuss the disportinate amount of native youths on the receiving end of our justice system.
"You are insinuating that he is a “traitor to his race”..."  No. I was stating [a fact] that Mr. Miranda shouldn't declare he is incapable of racism just because he [himself] is a Person of Color. He insists that it's "not about racism". But he wants to paint over a tribute mural to a murdered Black teen and replace it with business logos. Mr. Miranda says that he has been subjected to racial profiling his whole life. No doubt; the history of Puerto Ricans dealing with racial violence is long and extensive. That Puerto Rico is basically a stolen U.S. colony to this day testifies to this history.  But Mr. Miranda seems to have a lack of empathy for OTHERS who've also have a lifetime of experiencing systemic racism and violence. And that's not ok.
Not for much longer.  They're on the brink of extinction thanks to being infected with FIV, starved out, displaced and genetically swamped by their selectively-bred domesticated "descendants".  There are only about 35 Scottish wild cats (Felis sylvestris grampa) left.  Asian and African wild cats (F. s. ornatus & F. s. lybicus) almost gone, too.  And it's feral cats that have done them in.  Feral cats are an ecological disaster in the home-ranges of the very species from which they were bred.
Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people.   Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.    Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.  The race is rigged for sure!
Dick Rhyner is a despicable cretin that should be banned. At every turn he is only interested in maximizing the sensational and voids anything that contains compassion or intelligence. Along with the other dark denizens here, we see the dark underbelly of what modern 'conservatism' is - black as coal, just as hard and entirely soulless.
I think the outrage is because we consider ourselves to be fighting racism when we marginalize the overt expression of racism ("Saffron Colonial" food, a swastika tattoo, a confederate flag, a gentrified historically black neighborhood).  We are, however, failing to do anything about racism when we express outrage. Lobby for affordable housing near business centers to reverse gentrification, and for school funding to not be so heavily dependent on local property taxes (wherein poor neighbhorhood = poor school); reject NIMBYisms when we advocate for the changes in our neighborhoods (which necessarily forces negative changes on neighborhoods too busy/poor to advocate);  hire someone who is NOT a cis-het white man, even if that person is the most qualified (because he's had the most opportunities).  Sure, boycott a restaurant, but also, examine whether that action is enough to categorize you as "not a racist", or if it just makes you a person who "doesn't want to talk about it"...
It amazes me that some posters who have, in the past, supported officers shooting young black me who have no weapon and are running away from them now attack the State Police for shooting Finicum who was armed, refused their orders to get down on the ground and reached toward his pistol.  Your post is a very civil invitation for Outsider to explain the logic of such actions.  Well played, Sir.  regards, Gary
You might have to wait a while longer:    As an agnostic I am about 3.3% of the US population according to PEW Research Group.   The athiests about 2.4%.  According to a 2012 review by the National Council of Churches, the five largest denominations are  The Catholic Church, 68,202,492 members The Southern Baptist Convention, 16,136,044 members The United Methodist Church, 7,679,850 members The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,157,238 members The Church of God in Christ, 5,499,875 members  The Southern Baptist Convention, with over 16 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200 distinctly named Protestant denominations.  In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches.
You were clearly slamming President Trump.  If he was a old black woman, would you call him that?  So you hope for more diversity in power?  Would that include Sarah Palin, Ben Carson and Caitlin Jenner?
It's what you said about a black female poster--the widow of an Iraq war veteran--who disagreed with you under the old "comments" system.  I'm sure you'd rather forget it.  I didn't.  Don't think she has either (we're friends on FaceBook--I'll ask her).  And I don't need to judge you.  Your own words do that.
Based on the murdered victim's girlfriend's iPhone video, it looked like she was driving the car and the murdered victim was sitting in the passenger's seat.  I want to know why the white police officer was screaming orders at the passenger.   I'll bet the police officer has a jucy story of why he was on the passenger side of the car instead of the driver's  side.  And why was he shooting into the car when there were children in the back seat?  We already know the outcome of this case; innocent by virtue that it was a white police officer and guilty because the car's occupants were black.  Dats da way it's done in Texas.  Next.
Nah, the Black Panther candidate ran and won in 2008 and 2012. That's why they weren't prosecuted when threatening to night-stick white voters at voting booths in the lower 48.
President Obama and Clinton are denouncing Islamic extremism and "lone extremist" that are American born, Newton.  You're deliberately choosing to ignore that our nation's leaders are fighting for and protecting the Muslim innocent population.  There is a huge difference if only you can spend more time researching the facts.
Toni Morrison called Clinton our first black president - the title was not self-applied.
Or maybe he was just being black.
I believe it is you who is being coy, following 40-20's suit. However, unlike 40-20, you seem inclined to reply.   40-20, in his original comment, expressed what I believe is a dog whistle for his or her racist views. By using his or her comment to link a story limited in nature to details about the suspect in a murder case, who happens to be a black man, to the level of incarceration of black men in the United States, he or she suggests there is an obvious causal correlation between the two that is plain to see. Personally, I don't see any obvious correlation between this crime and rates of incarceration of black men in America.
No, Mr. Trump is not diverse. A single individual can't be diverse. Diversity is about collections or groups of people, the more diverse when they include more genders, types, backgrounds, ages, etc., and the less diverse when they are more uniform in the same factors.   And I'll help you out with why the "honor diversity" crowd doesn't like Trump. I honor diversity and I really object to what Mr. Trump has said in public about Mexicans, Muslims, women, blacks, handicapped, and so on. I don't hate him, but I do seriously object to his candidacy for president of this country. I can't speak for others.   Furthermore, hating an individual can't be bigotry. Bigotry is about hating groups and collections of people for their characteristics, gender, background, color, religion, preferences, age, etc. Disliking a person, even hating that person, for what he or she says, believes, or does, rather than that person's classification, is not bigotry.
Only that you assumed from both my post and that from jamesjames below, that we are somehow worried that the "Men in Black" are coming to take our firearms away, and the somewhat snide way in which you point out your assumption. But them some can't refrain from sarcasm for any reason.
Give it up, Black.  You don't belong on this site.  I'm sure there's a KKK site waiting for your input.
Right--white supremacist social, economic, political, judicial and educational institutions just up and vanished with the "Brown vs. the Kansas Board of Education" ruling in 1964, and it's all BETTER now.  That explains why a 2003 University of Chicago research study determined that a thousand employers in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee and Los Angeles hired white FELONS for entry-level positions preferentially over equally-qualified black applicants with NO criminal records.  Here's the "honesty" test: if this situation was reversed, and you were one of those who though QUALIFIED was denied a job would you look in the mirror and blame yourself, or those who discriminated against you when you applied for the job?  Inquiring minds wanna know...
As you know housing discrimination is illegal.  You are comfortable that Trump knowingly risked his bottom line to discriminate.  With as many real estate interests as he has, I wonder if he was even aware of individual brokers' actions.  The story about making blacks leave the floor of a casino is so egregious and illegal that I do not believe that it happened or if it did that Trump was behind it.  Blatant racial discrimination is illegal in many of its instances and lawyers are hungry to sue and share in the large settlements discrimination generally produces.  I would really like to hear media members openly and neutrally question Trump about his gender and racial beliefs.  As it stands, the anecdotal evidence strikes me as simple political manipulation intended to discredit the man based on stereotypes and unsubstantiated inferences.
Guess how many Americans are going to be at the Republican convention as delegates, who are African American.
Especially since that was back before the Legislature really abdicated any financial responsibility for the U of O and my income taxes were paying for more of it than they do today, that question tended to make me a little cranky as well.  My children weren't black or native American minorities or financially disadvantaged because both I and my wife worked, so maybe all the scholarship money went to affirmative action.   The non-minority middle class are the payers, not the recipients of governmental largesse, even that doled out by Duck U.  I've always commented on the fact that the Asian minorities in this country aren't treated any better than the Caucasians, however.  Wonder why that is; and why so many of them seem to excel in the difficult and therefore high-paying fields like math and science.  The phrase 'work ethic' keeps running through my mind, though.
Sure it does. What else would you call it? What is the reason for being armed...what would the justification be if not intimidation or to give out the message that they are willing to use deadly force? Would the Klan be allowed to carry at a public demonstration? How about an armed Gay pride parade?  how about black muslims carrying guns on a march to DC? Just what did this "standoff" accomplish for the ranch owners? Did they win ANYTHING? Did they gain one ounce of public support? The majority of the public has no understanding or sympathy. Does anyone even know what it was they were "protesting"? I don't, and I have followed all the news stories.  Are they against tribal ownership of lands? Against wildlife refuges? What? Who cares?
Unitarians are a fabulous lot, but why are they and the like minded churches so small? Even here in far-left Portland. And I'm voting for Bernie, just so you know. But as someone friendly to liberal religion I can say this, everyone bashing Jules or Imago on here is basically sounding like a single issue voter, and scarily given to group think. What if some people do think marriage is between a man and a woman? Big deal. You don't have to go to their church. (Interestingly, gays didn't seem too concerned about not being able to marry until fairly recently, but that's not my point) But to compare the fight for gay marriage to King's fight for racial justice is ludicrous. No one is better off, in any significant way, because the state of Oregon has approved their union. Blacks on the other hand, are vastly better off after the civil rights movement. By the way, no one is accusing the church or Jules of being anti-minority.
Hypothetically, a(n) [Race] individual was convicted of [Crime].  They had [Incidents] while they were incarcerated. They will have the following burdens to overcome if/when released: [Employment History], [Criminal History] and [Drug History].  We can provide [Services] to help them overcome their burdens and not re-offend.  Should they be released from prison [Early, On-time, Ever] with [Conditions]?  When I look at this, all of the listed factors can change the outcome except race.  I think determining race is useful for catching the suspect.  Once we've caught them, I see no additional value.  To me, looking at crime statistics through a race lens only promotes irrational fear.  (According to the statistics, only woman of Asian descent should be free.)
According to Neil Black, no crimes were ever committed before the invention of gun powder.
Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.  Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.  While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods.
Yale is private, the U of O is not. Slavery isn't just some long past forgotten event. It lasted for hundreds of years; today, African-Americans still feel they are second-class citizens. Imagine how you, if you're a white person reading this, would feel about attending a school where a building was named in honor of a white person that had owned and mistreated one of your ancestors. Time to forgive AND forget? I'd argue, "Hell, no!" Either one has the capacity to see another's point of view or one doesn't. It simply is unacceptable to continue to praise these men by leaving the buildings' names in place. They've had their day in the sun, it's time to retire them to the shade.  I propose we rename the two buildings either for other Oregonians with cleaner backgrounds or else for black civil rights leaders such as WEB Du Bois or Frederick Douglass.
Apparently, traveling to the protest with his weapon and bringing along 4 extra ‘high capacity’ clips for his gun…..  and ‘staging’  a confrontation  claiming unarmed people are shoving,  punching and kicking you and forcing you to draw your weapon because you fear for your life from attacks via ‘hand to hand combat’……………..  looks a little like planning ahead to commit a mass shooting,  especially when those you claim are punching and kicking you are more than 15 feet away from you and could not have reached you, let alone punch and kick you….   Silly justice system,  he is a white man brandishing a gun,   his intentions MUST be honorable, Purposely traveling to a place that has been scheduled to have a peaceful  ‘black lives matter[too]’ and noticing there are black people there, would make any good RW  coward  fear for their life
And yet when Trumpty-Dumpty or Rush ("he just LOVES little black Dominican boys!") Limbaugh say unpleasant things about black folks, that's OK because it's "freedom of expression."  Double-standard much?  Oh yeah, and this is what Muhammad 'Ali (rah'matullahi alayhi) said about Frazier after their third fight: "I always bring out the best in the men I fight, but Joe Frazier, I'll tell the world right now, brings out the best in me. I'm gonna tell ya, that's one helluva man, and God bless him."  Funny neither you nor Flowers thought to mention that.
Some Oregonians can join the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Both blacks and whites are members and they number about 170,000 nationwide. You can learn about how our ancestors fought the English.  If you think this the original patriots were non-violent, you have go to do some research!
Mr Minshall, what exactly do you propose today's society can do to "correct" all of those terrible inequities committed by those evil and racist, rich white people?  Especially the ones who have been dead for over 100 years?    Eliminate the liquor industry?  That was tried once.  Eliminate porn?  What do you suggest, killing all of those who buy Playboy?  Collect all of the prostitutes on the street and give them taxpayer money for life?  Then catch all of the Johns and kill them?   How about the former POTUS and his association with a convicted pedophile, vacationing on a private  sex island?  How about the drug trade?  White owners there too?  Just shoot them all?      Social engineering by a government does not work.  You cannot force anyone to be free.  Sex trade has been around over 2000 years.  Alcohol has been around as well.  Mankind has an ugly history and the continual rubbing of societies nose in the filth has not been successful so perhaps if you were God, you could ......
Obviously the FBI didn't find the damage they were looking for and are now digging for something to add charges. Without knowing the exact condition the artifacts were in prior to the protesters arrival it would be fraudulent to even make the accusations and is such a waste of more money already wasted by FBI and Gov. Brown. The protesters actually took photos of how the refuge was and its contents along with video and has been reported on multiple news outlets minus the main stream media of course. I see several comments from black libs talking about the protesters whiteness and white privilege. Defending Liberty is not about race and if you have allowed yourself to buy into those lies instead of fact checking and researching the issue then you have your own ignorance to blame for the loss of your freedoms. after the hypocrisy of so many BLM protesters on this issue they have lost millions of white supporters for their cause.
Nothing against mixing cultures, but it doesn't take a genius to realize naming a drink Plantation Press in a historically black neighborhood is pretty fucked up. #duh
Which party did JFK and LBJ belong to, Larry? Which party pushed and passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act? Those were passed by Northern Democrats (over the fierce objections of Southern Democrats) -- admittedly with support from (in those days, enlightened) Northern Republicans. Since then, those enlightened (Northern) Republicans have switched to the Democratic Party, while the South has turned Republican. This has been a conscious Republican strategy since Nixon. It was even foretold by LBJ when -- after signing the acts above -- he said "we have lost the South for at least a generation." Republicans' recent efforts to restrict voting -- which differentially restricts minority voting -- is evidence, as is the constant Republican harping on imagined fraud in welfare, which leads (and is intended to lead) poor whites to imagine that poor blacks are benefiting at their expense, all the while REAL fraud in defense spending and the financial sect is overlooked.
There's lots of racists, on the left, on the right, in the middle. Here's an article from the Washington Post     https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html   "At the time the suit was filed, Trump had been thinking about veering away from his father’s ­focus on providing housing for ­lower- and middle-income residents of Brooklyn and Queens, and envisioning his future as a developer of luxury buildings for the rich in Manhattan.  But now the first thing most people were hearing about Trump was that he was being accused of discrimination."  followed a few paragraphs later by:  “What we didn’t do was rent to welfare cases, white or black,” Trump wrote in his 1987 autobiography. “I’d rather fight than fold, because as soon as you fold once, you get the reputation of being a folder.”
I was born (1966) and raised in Portland.  As a teenager I loved taking a "quiet" walk along the waterfront.  Soon I found there were not many places where you could find "quiet".  So many people were moving to Portland from California.  There used to be a billboard that said something like feel free to visit but please don't stay.  I left the state in 2004 (only because all the rain was affecting my sanity) and the last time I visited (2016) I didn't recognize it.  Massive gentrification in NE Portland.  The number of homeless people seems to have sky rocketed.  Although racial diversity was always a small percentage (you would still run into an Asian, Mexican or Black) it is all but extinct now.  I drove through my old neighborhoods and all I saw were middle-aged whites.  Where are the children, the elderly, the minorities??  I let my family know that was the last time I would be coming to Portland.  The anger is just too much for me to handle.  RIP Portland, OR
Are you asking the white male GOP candidates for those as well or just the African American and women candidates?
Hey, just root for the Blazers & say hi to LaMarcus & we can be friends . . . no, i digress from a serious topic and "shame".  I got a lucky reprieve and moved instantly to Portland.  The Financial Crisis made it work.  Otherwise, Greed would have happened sooner, it was indeed well on it's way.        I also worked as an artist, having two studios simultaneously.  One the cheap private one i arranged at Cathedral Park for my private adventures and one that was, well more of a music and art underground thing for me until it wasn't.  I didn't dump Portland, it just was Time.         Yeah we can say this is progress.        We can say we value artists.         However, mean it.  All over the world, in too numerous examples Artists become the "Tools of Gentrification".  We often are brave enough or poor enough to go into areas other folks initially avoid as too "gritty" or whatever.  In Portland that could also translate as "too black"-ah History.  Sad white Playground city. Greed Disease
That would be the pot calling the kettle black, wouldn't it?
One anecdotal story does not make a fact. FACT - Planned Parenthood was started by Margaret Sanger to keep "Negros" from increasing in population.
This is getting downright ridiculous the first robbery at least gave us somewhat of a description; this time they're just clueless?   Sighs back to being regular old mountain view once again... And talk about bold to go from Monday to Wednesday?   This type of crime seems to be increasing in frequency for the entire year of 2016; and it's not even half over yet
Your Hitler history is a bit limited.    The Jews had the Yellow stars, the gays had the pink triangles, purple triangles were Jehovahs Witnesses, Black Triangle with Blod were mental defectives, Black triangle with a Z for gypsies.  Black triangles also were for prostitutes, alcoholics, drug addicts, vagrants, pacifists, and lesbians,  Red triangles for political prisoners, social democrats, socialists, trade unionists, Freemasons, communists, and anarchists.
So you consider Hispanic people and middle eastern/African refugees barbarians?
I'm no great fan of Trump for POTUS but, if it's him or Hillary, I'll vote for him over a lying, conniving, incompetent  "what difference does it make" Hillary.  Trump has shot himself in the foot more than once, but I'm fed up with top-feeders like The Clintons who think it's their turn because they've been in the game a long time and/or are the desirable race/gender for another First (Black, Female, ,etc.) President-thing.  The main reason Trump gets terrible press is the terrible press.  They forgive or overlook Hillary and other Democrats' every flaw (yes, they do have huge flaws), and nitpick ad nauseum everything Trump does--or any other Republican.   Of course, we know the Democrat Monarchy will always win in provincial, dysfunctional Hawaii, so there's almost no point in someone like me voting.   Dems are likely counting on that, but I will do my civic duty, knowing that there are three certainties in life--death, taxes and a DDD Hawaii--Destructive, Dysfunctional, Democrat.
I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals. Nothing has been done to keep blacks from voting, only to keep anyone not entitled to vote from voting. There is no evidence that voting ID laws have had any impact on anyones ability to vote.
Oh, I thought American history has documented, well, that thousands of African American and Chinese were brought here by force for the sole purpose of slave labor, Malone
The problem with trying to give labels to everything is that eventually the label itself become the point and gateway of prejudice. 2 cases in point.  - I have a friend that someone once referred to him as "African American" and he was instantly insulted and angry. His response was "You Americans have to label everything. I am neither African nor American. I am Black English"   His point was that he was already labeled before they knew anything about him.  - I have another friend that filled out a questioner and put down that he was African American. Later he was accused of lying, since he is "white." He explained " I was born and grew up in South Africa, and now i am an American Citizen. How much more "African American" can I be ?"  -
Would you as a parent have handled it differently? Possibly, but it's also possible that you're speaking from a stance where you wouldn't be paraded in a room and then singled out, while the guy you're supposed to trust is having an entire team "touch" you to get over their "fear" of blacks.   As a coach, I have seen this encounter all too often, but instead of singling out my players of color to use as an example, I find ways to show my teams areas of success on the court that can be exploited and used to be successful and hopefully win.  The kids will always remember the day that their coach asked them to be "statues in museum." That's not something one easily forgets.
Hardly “seeming pettiness,” but more of Christine Flowers’ typical underhanded bigotry. White media propagandists hated Muhammad ‘Ali because he let them know he didn’t fear them.  At a time when black folks were killed for less, Muhammad ‘Ali declared: “I ain’t draft-dodging! I ain’t burning no flag! I ain’t running away to Canada! I’m staying right here! You want to send me to jail? Fine, you go right ahead. I’ve been in jail for 400 years!…but I ain’t going no 10,000 miles to help murder and kill other poor people. If I die, I’ll die right here, right now, fighting YOU, if I want to die. YOU my enemy, not no Chinese, no Vietcong…!”  Comparing ‘Ali with Trump is egregiously insulting, to say nothing of absurd. When did Trump ever say ANYTHING as honest or courageous, or face such risk for speaking out? Trump LEGALLY dodged the draft.  BTW–‘Ali repented of his self-proclaimed title, and said so–because that title rightly belongs only his Creator.  Allahu Akbar–only God is Great.
Homosexuality is not abnormal. It is natural. Its been part of human existence 12,0000 years before you were born and part of sapien dna 400,000 years prior. It occurs in nearly every mammal on earth, including but not limited to both male and females of the species. The same things you are saying about people of "abnormal" genders is the same as was said about black's and women's rights and prior to that land owners. There will always be scripture that agrees with your position, any position. I can quote scripture from Jesus healing the Roman Centurion's male concubine without acting offended about his sexuality. But no, clearly god doesn't want you to bake someone a cake because of what they do in the privacy of their bedroom. That makes perfect since to someone.
Judith Mowry, policy analyst with the city of Portland, said at a Eugene City Club meeting that a disproportionate percentage of the homeless are people of color. What I experienced last night at the Springfield City Council meeting qualifies as an example of white privilege.  White, housed people trying to push our marginalized homeless population to the outskirts of town with flimsy excuses like our history shows we did to people of color.  Of course this has nothing to do with safety since laws already exist that address obstructing traffic.  I have never personally witnessed panhandlers cause "dangerous traffic situations" or "safety hazards and delays" in a roadway or at busy intersections but it would interesting to document with video just how often and how long motorists are delayed because of these donations in public space. The people who complain about this should be ashamed of themselves. Again, privilege.
It appears to me that the Dallas police force has, unfortunately, and undeservidly reaped the whirlwind that has been sown over so many years by so many police officers who somehow came to believe that wearing a badge gave them the right to shoot black (and white) men with impunity. While I have no doubt that officer fear (it does not really matter whether real or imagined) drives a good deal of these killings, the underlying cause is still a culture of entitlement and coverup within police agencies.
Continued response to Rick Wicks: 1964, Current Civil Rights Act passed and signed by Lyndon Johnson with 80% republican support and 68% democrat support. 1965, Voting Rights act passed and signed, again with a very large majority of republicans voting for it and a much smaller majority of democrats voting for it. 1973, The democratic party adopts Margaret Sangers Eugenics program which was partially titled "Negro Population Control". Ms Sanger is the founder of Planned Parenthood. Since that time, there have been very few republicans switching to the democratic party but much more democrats switching to the republican party for economic reasons, not race issues as your side believes. Restricting voting to legal American citizens has done nothing at all to restrict the ability to vote for anyone. If you want to find racism, which party always identifies race and which party does not. The republicans do not identify race so which is racist? Kind of logical which party uses race
This may be a crucial element to this issue, and bears consideration.  I don't know if you saw the Oscars last night, but there is some similarity with the race issue.  I'm sure the great majority of those attending (whites) would not consider themselves "racist."  Yet the fact is minorities were essentially ignored in academy voting.  While there is a clear difference between belief and behavior, the first almost always has an effect on the second.  A church that formally declares women aren't equal to men doesn't have to be full of domestic abusers, but may give tacit--even if unintended--support to them.  Same with "I believe people should be able to choose their partner, we just won't marry them in our church."  Not quite as bad as "I'm not a racist, but a restaurant owner should be able to exclude Blacks from his restaurant."  But pretty close. Quite a conundrum, how members who aren't homophobic justify belonging to a church that is.  Cognitive dissonance indeed.
Thank you, Mr Nordlund, for this important column. I note that you actually understate the history of this despicable practice. It wasn't merely the banks denying loans to minorities going back throughout history, but it was the stated policy of the United States government to do so. The creation of the Federal Housing Administration in the 1930s was designed to help white homeowners only. The regulations used a color-coded system for different "grades" of neighborhoods, and blacks and other minorities were explicitly prohibited from getting mortgages for those grades supposedly above their station. The practice ostensibly ended with housing reforms in the 1960s, but, as this column demonstrates, it still continues off the books. This is the dictionary definition of institutional discrimination, and we suffer from its legacy, all of us, to the present day.
Pretty funny that you had previously called LGBT folks hateful and prejudiced.   Pot calling the kettle black.
I need some myself and plan to get some soon.  I live in an apartment in the Cook Inlet apartment in the woods.  A black bear kept visiting.  The workmen forgot to lock the door to the garbage and I saw the bear running across the lawn just a few yards away with the white plastic bag bouncing along side of him.  There wasn't much in it.  I locked the door.  He came back and tried as he might to pull the door open but couldn't.  Another day there was a man and woman looking at the bear outside my apt and the woman was throwing food to it.  I chased her off.  A few days later I ran into the man and he said he just wanted to see the bear and it was hungry.  Dumb.  I informed him (1) if he wants feed it do it outside his building not mine and (2) if you continue to feed the bear he will die not by starvation, but by being shot.  Is there a particularly good brand or style of container you can recommend. I have pet rabbits I put in a pen in front of my apartment.  I sit outside with them.
Student newspaper outraged that someone (not Nish) opined that the diversity committee was not diverse.  Because:  lack of diversity is not an issue if it benefits black folk, apparently.   Nish agrees.  Seems to be a perfect fit for PCC.
Heh.  RR never makes a legitimate point when it comes to black folks.  I've followed his rather checkered 'commenting career' for a while.  Saw him go completely apoplectic when a black lady talked back to him once.  Actually said he wanted to 'put her in her place.'  But my question to you is, was there ever a black Anchorage Assembly chairperson before Ms. Gray-Jackson?  No?  Then neither yours nor Richard the Rhino-headed's objection has any merit whatsoever.  First time.  It's noteworthy.  Get over it.
Yeah, 8wop, let's forget about all the mass killings in our public schools and movie theaters while you're at it.  President Obama has hosted many TV announcements to the nation over the senseless killings of innocent American citizens (i.e. the 9 black churchgoers).  He's pleaded with the NRA to meet him in the center of working to protect lives and you have the jewels to criticize our classy President Obama?  Must be nice to live in a glass house huh?
lol wow! ok well to start, you have no idea where ive been or not been.  Actually, I have spent quite a good amount of time in Arizona, including the slums of Phoenix, so try again.  Second, dont defend this tripe.  Its a terrible, Kipling-level, fear the unwashed hordes piece, implying that mexicans WILL shoot you just for being white and alive.  (sidenote: I don't usually find the WW's coverage of brown folks like myself as 'tone-deaf' as a lot of other people in this city do.  But holy shit, your defense of this terrible slice of hatred and white anger is really giving me pause.  I have always respected and enjoyed your writing, but I am shocked to learn that you think something like this is worthy of defense.  I have defended your paper against others who say that you are uncaring and uninterested in people of color in PDX, but perhaps I was misinformed)
So, you want to consider aspects of character?  Two of the judges were appointed by Democrat presidents.  The only one appointed by a Republican is Judge Callahan, approved by every Democrat senator.  A profile last year in The Daily Journal explained: "A hoofer with a sense of humor, Callahan likes to surprise judicial and legal gatherings by starting discussions about serious topics and ending with a quip about appellate judges who tap dance around issues. She then pulls off her black robe to reveal a sequined costume and tap shoes. She's been known to hop on a tabletop or in one case on a judicial bench during these special events and do some pretty impressive steps. "I may be the highest ranking tap dancer in federal court," Callahan said with a grin during a recent interview in her chambers in the Sacramento federal court building. "It is fun and it has a certain shock value."" http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/who-is-consuelo-callahan
If you read this thread of comments you will see that the "blame game" is in full-force.  It accomplishes absolutely nothing POSITIVE and only intensifies the divisions already present regarding the issue of violence in America and, specifically, the violence between the police and the Black community.    During the riots which followed the acquittal of the officers involved in his beating in 1992, Rodney King famously asked "can't we all just get along?"  The answer, sadly, was "NO, We Can't".... It's 24 years later and, again sadly, the answer continues to be NO.  What the hell's wrong with us as a society?  Can't we, somehow, do better than this?  Forget the "blaming" for a moment and perhaps offer just a little suggestion or two regarding what we (you and I and all the others who "meet" on this site) can do to help stop this escalating violence.  BTW: That's my suggestion.....quit blaming and start think of ways to move things in a positive direction........ regards, Gary
I totally agree w/you.  I don't know, truthfully, that much about radical Islam terrorism but I do know racism when I smell its stink.  My Father is so racist he can't watch sports anymore.  THAT's so frightening to me.  To hate simply because of color.   On a show I've already linked to, a former African American NYPD Detective said that Blacks were treated better when white people owned them a chattel.  He got very emotional talking about NYPD now and the problems of racism w/in ranks.........nationwide.
These laws like NC's HB2 are not about anyones safety but about further stigmatizing non passing trans people and encouraging violence against them. Public education is going to be key here, but just like the civil rights movement for black Americans there will still be people who refuse to listen and will remain ignorant and aggressive towards people who they see as different.
Yup Dean old boy, the next POTUS will be named Hillary Rodham Clinton whether you're ready to move into the future or not. Your head must be spinning madly with first a popular two term Democratic Black President and now a woman who has been so unjustly vilified by right wing media and the Sanders campaign. She has prevailed in spite of the raw BS spewed against her for over thirty years and yes the Democratic Party will regain control of the Senate because of your Trump monster and then she will appoint at least one and possibly two or three more SCOTUS justices over her two term presidency. I'm so looking forward to another Democratic president and Congress unencumbered and gridlocked by the obstructionist McConnell. Yahoo Dean!!  "Well Ya better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone cause the times they are achangin"
Hey Lars, I'm familiar with the statistics, but I don't see the relationship to this article.  As a Left leaning fiscal conservative (yes, I love Freedom, etc.), I want to make sure the money I pay in taxes for a program like this is keeping the most likely future offenders in prison (and saving me money by releasing those least likely to offend again).   The research cited here shows that the program two big flaws: 1. It doesn't accurately predict future criminal behavior; 2. It consistently over-predicts the future criminal behavior of Blacks.  I don't think you meant this, but your comment infers that releasing Whites likely to commit future crimes is okay, and keeping Blacks that are not likely future criminals incarcerated is justified.    Here's your chance to clarify your position.
On behalf of the black market; THANK YOU!
What a loss. I'm so sorry to hear this.  "No Viet Cong. Called Me Nigger" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd9aIamXjQI&feature=youtu.be
You've just offered yourself up as a prime example of that.  Try not to be so 'thinned-skinned.'  All the black and brown folks aren't out to get you.
You can't run as a "progressive" out one side of your mouth, be an unquestioning rubber-stamp for the PPB out yet another, and give money, time, and labor uncritically to a church that hates LGBTQ people, disabled people, and believes mixed-race marriages aren't okay out yet another.  Bailey failed spectacularly because Portland voters don't like hypocrites, and I can't think of anyone more hypocritical in this or any race. Perhaps it's time to consider something other than politics, Mr. Bailey, or potentially washing your hands of a church that's proud of the hate it preaches and shameless in the harm it does...and maybe reconsidering why unfettered police power is a good idea...and maybe realizing that there's a whole Portland east of Chávez that you ignored in your campaign.   I'm not happy another candidate didn't make the runoff, but I'm on my knees thanking God, not the angry hateful Imago Dei ""God"", but God as the Bible tells me, that Creepy Jules can't be Mayor at this point.
It's attitudes like the letter writer that are part of the problem (note... part). What's the big deal if a cop shoots a black criminal? I would hope that everyone would be concerned if the police gun down criminal suspects (or school cafeteria workers) before the courts have a chance to decide guilt and an appropriate punishment. Thomas seems to think that black criminals don't deserve that process.
Ernie: the two have little to do with one another. Yes, there are some cases where alcohol is sold by Alaska Natives. Bethel is not the only place; the City of  Klawock owns the liquor store in that town. These are, however minor by comparison to the major outlets which are caucasian owned. It was white settlers who brought the stuff in the first place. Along with other things which have been disadvantageous to indigenous people.
What blankety, blank message?  tRump hasn't had a message for the rational voters since he announced his pathetic candidacy.  All he's talked about is how much he hates women, building a wall, bringing a lawsuit against anyone that shines a spotlight on his corrupt shenanigans etc. etc.  I hope he stays on this path up to election day.
Now look in the mirror and  say the same thing about your comment, Black.  You have an uncontrollable habit of siding with unlawful behaviors.  Why is that?
Call me crazy, but I'm going to say "new negroes" if people ask me what that New Negroes show is titled.
And people wonder why so many young black males are incarcerated?
There was a white woman having an affair with a black guy in unit 3. They deserve this
The "Christian Right",AKA,the Alaskan Chapter of the Texas KKK..He's lucky he didn't get burnt at the stake,I imagine if he would have been black,he would have..
I think it's a bit misleading to say that blacks are 4.1/7.5 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively.   From the report, those figures are based on the numbers of probation/parole violations as a proportion of the *total* adult populations of each group. On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively.   Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population. Whether this fact is symptomatic of systemic racism is debatable, but this article seems to suggest that the disproportionality is *because* blacks are significantly more likely to violate probation/parole than whites, which misrepresents the report.
'oldvalleyguy' Your screen name says it all for me.  God forbid it happens to someone in your family and I promise you will sing a different tune.  Whether they be Black, White, Hispanic, or Other.  Resisting arrest does not give anyone the right to shoot an unarmed individual at point blank range.  You sir are a jerk and that is being kind!
This is not correct. The 3% figure for African Americans does not include any of the 7% who are counted as being "of more than one race.'
You know Black, since you've been around I think of you every time I flush the toilet....
As opposed to the APD pigs that routinely kill brown people for sport?
Huh.  So folks on welfare bankrolled her into the Anchorage Assembly?  Funny, usually the folks who spend money bribing politicians are rich white folks.  So what is your basis for claiming that Ms. Gray-Jackson is a paid puppet of poor black folks living in RVs?  Her color?  But I thought you said you didn't CARE about that.  Please explain...
Lets see how bad the comments get on this story. Everyone knows black people don't deserve what they work for or achieve, only what they are given. Who knows what happens when blacks succeed...they are written out of history... after what they have built is either taken or destroyed.
Ernie Black   When more people (not exclusively carpenters) are dying from self mutilation by hammer than are dying on our streets and highways, then yes.
This man was threatened by several angry black youth who gathered to express anger and outrage at white people, all of you criticizing Mike should put yourselves in the same scenario !!
Even if eating meat gave us immortality, I feel unnecessarily ending the life of another precious living being is immoral. The law is on your side at the moment but denying women and people of color equal rights, for example, was legal at one time as well. The issue here is you feel your happiness and life is more important than the many lives of other animals that you are killing. I doubt the life of any human is worth the unnecessary suffering and death of our animal friends. The key word there is"unnecessary" and in almost every case killing others is now unnecessary in this modern world.
Your racist bigotry against all religions except christian and all government except pure conservative Republican no matter the topic spews forth again.  Obama is to blame for everything being a black man daring to hold the highest office in the land.  If only more Bush, Trump, Cruz, ad nauseum were in charge, the nation would be just hunky dory.  Stupid.
True but you don't see the people that the black criminals shoot or try to kill going out with signs that say whitelivesmatter or clerkslivesmatter or oldpeopleslivesmatter all of whom have been assaulted by blacks. so spin this anyway you want reverse racism slows more progress than racism. at least you will know how a racist feels when you meet them, all the secretly repressed/depressed/regressed white folks that act like you can relate or go out of your way to have a black friend just makes me sick... You should never change your behavior because of another persons skin color... NO MATTER WHAT COLOR IS IN CHARGE!
Very few people have the black-and-white beliefs that you seem to hold Neighbor98. Most people who strongly support abortion rights also support some restrictions (say, prohibiting elective abortion in the third trimester). Many people who believe that gun ownership is a fundamental right also support strong gun control - including millions of NRA members. And many people who love and accept gays and lesbians are still uncomfortable with gay marriage. As the son of a lesbian, I find it much more productive to engage those people and get them to understand how important marriage is to my mom and my entire family, rather than demonize them as "evil."
Hey neato Neil Black. Nice to know you bow to the King and ask" mother may I" from the Government instead of using your Constitutional [ that's right, I used that scary word to you Liberals ] rights. You are a SHEEP and nothing more.
Don't look now, Conrad, but we've had a two-party system for over two hundred years.  The party you'd like to have doesn't exist and likely never will; at least not in our lifetime.  Sooooo, who ya gonna vote for when Sanders doesn't make the DNC nomination?  Sanders can't win the presidential election without the black or Hispanic vote.  Latest national news I've heard, Hillary is doing rather well with both of these voter populations.  Besides, if Hillary is elected our new president we won't be getting one president; we'll have  two.  Can we say the same about Sanders?
It is ironic that Trump says he does not need the GOP to win but he took on the face of the party as the GOP organization is running behind him putting in play a nationwide campaign they started on after the last major defeat for the presidency. Learning from the past 2 failures for the White House the GOP has formulated a better process so they think that will put more "boots on the ground" in each state, especially the states they have to win and more one to one "outreach" to the voters, just like Obama did twice. The GOP campaign also desired after the Romney defeat to grow their appeal to voters beyond their base. Trump had no big plan for a nationwide campaign except to keep on speaking and that problem is a big one since Trump needs crossover voters to vote and he needs big blocks of voters like women, blacks and Latinos and they are not on board with him. Trump just brags about how the Blacks, Latinos and Women love him and that is not the reality.
"But black students who want the UO to drop Deady’s name say honoring Deady today keeps black students from attending and thriving at the UO."  Complete tommyrot! I challemge anyone to produce any evidence to support this rediculous statement. Schill ought to suck it up and get back to running the university.... or get out of town.
Martin - I just wanted to let you know that this article really encapsulates all of the reasons I moved away from Portland last year. I don't care if you are serious or not, it doesn't really matter.  I can not imagine how miserable it must make other people to be around someone like you. Your entire persona is cultivated to be empty, smug, self-superior, and gleefully weak. You seem to have disdain for your fellow man, and you think it makes you look cool for some reason. You're bothered by masculinity, wealth, patriotism, and tradition. That's what you wanted to mold my native city into - a safe space for fragile, feminine people with ironic opinions. You've done well.  Well, it's all yours now. There's no going back. Portland (and the Willy Week) were once credible, serious participants in a loosely affiliated American counterculture. And now they are . . . this. You just wrote a "Your Fave is Problematic" Tumblr post in the WW about one of America's greatest living songwriters.
Pot-Kettle-Black, Wavemaker.
Bunk.  Obama got elected by black privilege and George Soros.
Well, but that is all due to the effects of generations of African Americans being victimized by racism.    I am in favor of all black males giving up their guns.   But the white men need to surrender their guns too.  I would be OK with Native Americans living on reservations being allowed to have guns.    You never hear about Native Americans shooting each other.
When I was younger, college-age, I went through periods where I was flat broke, or less than broke. Really glad that didn't go on my permanent record (does this count?).
In the all too true lyrics of Bob Dylan,                                                  In Patterson                                                      that's just the way it goes.                                                         If your black                                                             Ya better not show                                                            Up on the street                                                                  Lest ya wanna draw the heat.
I wonder what the fat, old, white guys would say if all the positions on the Supreme Court were currently filled by black women?
I did not care for the remake of Roots.  It has nothing to do with race I just thought it was poorly made and not entertaining.  After all that is why movies are made to entertain and make money.  It is interesting to note that only about 50% of blacks in the USA can trace their ancestry back to a slave.  Even fewer whites can be traced back to a slave owner.  I have no guilt over slavery or the subdegation of the native american peoples.  I was not there. Maybe blacks should feel guilt because most of their ancestors who were enslaved were enslaved by other black.  Of course that is abserd but then so is the notion that I should somehow feel guilt about something that happened  way before I was even though of as possible  by my great grandparents.
"Claire Syrett, meet the Black Market, Black Market, Claire Syrett and the tens of thousands of people who buy and use cannabis in Eugene." Do you really think people are going to consistently pay 20% more or go to the source they've used for years?
Would we accept a law that insisted white babies be adopted by white parents?
Those stupid liberals are just awful!!! I mean, how can they think that its fair to infringe on our rights to shoot the gay and latino and black people, and keep the women in the kitchen!  I mean, isn't it just an outrage to assume that these people have civil rights???
Actually, the Democrats may have handed the nomination to the one person who might lose to Trump. If she chooses a VP that isn't a Sanders or Warren, there will be a historically huge voter cross vote, while Republican Women may vote for her, millions of white male low income traditionally union Democrats will look around to make sure no one is watching and then vote for Trump. Oh Hillary Clinton, please choose Bernie as your VP. Don't consign many liberals to the hell of having to vote for Trump because he is the only one who truly means what he says about bringing business back to America. Hugh Massengill, Eugene
I am puzzled as to the picture associated with this story. While giving praise to the young woman whose photo was used, where are the photos of the two, African Americans, Tamara and Nina Richardson, that the post is writing about? I hope there is a new article which corrects this....otherwise people may assume that the" image" of "white" Eugene, is actually more important than the actual story!!!!
And let's ban alcohol consumers from having a drivers license. Or ban tobacco smokers from working in health care. See, we can all play this game. Maybe we should ban non-whites from playing on golf courses. How about banning gay kids from the Boy Scouts? This game can go on for days.
Why do you have to support unchecked illegal immigration and open border in order to reach out to hispanics?!!
BJ, your suggestion that low income residents of Portland do not understand their own needs and desires perplexes me.  It is a bit snobby- as if the poor need middle class whites to tell them what they should want. And, for blacks and latinos, home ownership[ is pretty much their only chance for a nest egg.  Unless they are union they don't really get the jobs with stock options and generous 401k matches.  The fact that redlining once existed doesn't make the handful of black residents around Alberta less attached to their homes.  You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences.   Finally, I note you put a lot of trust in the people who own large apartment complexes to not exploit the inherent vulnerability that comes with being a renter.  The SFH gives people autonomy.  Yes, housing prices can drop, but so can any other investment.  Take my 401k- please...
404 error  page not available................  BTW  'killed by cop'  is a LEADING cause of death here in Portland,  for both blacks AND  whites,  are you saying that black people deserve to die for being black??
LGBTQ rights are not special rights.  People are asking for the same rights everyone else possesses.  For example, the right to freedom from discrimination.  There is no federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment or housing that applies to LGBTQ folks as is the case for women and people of color.  It is up to each state.  Fortunately, Oregon's legislature has passed laws to prohibit such discrimination.  It is not only members of the LGBTQ population who appreciate having equal rights (NOT special rights) in Oregon, but also their grandparents, parents, brothers and sisters, other family members, and their friends.  If the government has any function it is to make sure everyone has equal rights under the law.
Everyone in plain black pajamas might do the trick.
Haven't watched any of Il Duce Trump's "leftist" gatherings where anyone who looked(black/brown) or acted anti-Trump were physically assaulted, shouted at, and shoved out of the event?
Difference is I back up my oddball stories with facts which you can't refute.  Disparaging them isn't the same as refuting.  And you're the one who said to a black female commentator--in your online comments--that you wanted to "put her in her place."  Do boy scouts do that?  Maybe the ones who wear sheets...
There's nothing 'personal' about a blog post; its a blog on the internet for people to READ. Duh. Yes its old, but its full of foolish stereotypes and clearly Hurst was in no danger other than damaging his reputation by making his fear of a brown planet public. It was 'rumored' to have a high rate of non-violent crime? He didn't even actually know, just assumed from the mumblings of his majority white friend base. There is no defending his idiotic rantings, he's just neurotic and has never extended himself beyond posting things on the internet he should probably keep to himself.
Bill: In 1969 I was teaching in an inner-city high school in Riverside, California.  The issue of affirmative action arose regarding "advanced placement" courses.  I presented the following idea which was adopted and worked.  1) We determined the percentage makeup of the student body (Black, Hispanic and non-Black/Hispanic.  We had almost a 1/3, 1/3 1/3 composition as it turned out. 2)  We determined the seats available in the classes....36 was the number used. 3)  The affected Departments chose their enrollment using those percentage figures. 4)  Minorities were "equally" represented based on their percentage of the school enrollment. 5) It worked out well, since there was no "unfair" affirmative action and no basis for claims of racial or ethnic discrimination.    As, I think,you and I agree, we need to address racial/ethnic/sexist discrimination while, at the same time, working to be fair, rather than punitive, in so doing.  best regards, Gary
Are you supposed to be a journalist, Lizzy Acker? Does the truth mean anything to you? If you were assaulted by a black man, and the police asked you for a description of your assailant, would you say he was white? Would it be racist to say he was black?  You're so busy slapping labels on other people and their comments try this one, and see if it fits you: fascist.  By the way, I don't believe for a second that you are graciously keeping up these comments you have deemed "racist" just to show you're not a censor. No, dear. You left those comments up because your new comment system hasn't been generating as many comments as you would like.  I know this because I, like other commenters here, have received e-mails from "Civil Comments" inviting me to post more comments.
The murdered victim, according to one news story, was a well loved and respected elementary school cafeteria supervisor.  Wake up America.  This can happen to any brown color skin citizen.  Up the ante if he or she is  black.  Pulled over for an out tail light.  Dead with four bullet holes in his body.  I have no empathy for this cop.  None whatsoever.
Isn't it ironic how butt-hurt some white men get when there is a story honoring the contributions of a group that they are not a part of.  I wonder if they ever stop and think, "Maybe this this how African Americans feel all the time".  It should also be noted that these are the same folks who rally against political correctness and hypersensitivity. On average, I would say white men are the most hypersensitive, easily-offended demographic in America.
How about back when black/hispanics used to live on MLK Blvd. instead of California transplants and yuppie hipsters alongside their organic food grocery chains and microbreweries?  I don't see this gentrification stuff going away.  Pretty soon, all the young white people of the next generation will be making similar claims about the good old days when Portland was "weird" instead of the semi-Oakland/semi-SF situation we'll have in 10-20 years.  People in Portland are so clueless sometimes to the things that don't happen to them.
And that has happened in New York state? Or maybe eliminating property taxes, income taxes and corporate taxes for ten years has generated a boom of business in the state? If the country did the same, only set as permanent policy, then we would see economic growth unlike this country has ever seen. These policies work and work well. Income disparity has grown much worse in the last 7 years due to democrat strangulation of business in this country. Also, unemployment among minorities, especially blacks and black teens has skyrocketed in the last 7 years. As many leaders in the minority community have pointed out, the democrats have done nothing to actually help them in any way. What do they say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Mmmmmm.
What do pedophiles have to do with the LGBT community? Pedophiles take advantage of kids that can't give consent. You are suggesting the LGBT are the same.
Totally wrong! Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. And hypocritically enough, nobody from the BLM "movement" is parading and "protesting" black on black crime. There were no BLM protesting against Freddie Gray any of the 19 times he sold drugs to other black folks. The only time you people get your dander up is when you feel the need to persecute cops and law abiding gun owners.
I've lived all my life in Oregon, but I've always believed our #1 problem was the entitlement mentality that has developed, fostered by the unions and our criminal governors Goldschmidt and Kitzhaber, now with a boost from bisexual Brown. And you are a self-righteous egoist, testifying in court, writing a book, and being a guest for a program aren't that impressive.
Don't look now, X, but the majority of students attending the posh Ivy League universities are White.  And what about the Mormon universities; they too are predominantly White.  We don't hear people screaming about the nearly all White universities.  But print a local story about a potential tribal college opening and naysayers are all over it like white on rice.
You're confusing "a" problem with "the" problem. Certainly black poverty, and the sick culture that has grown up around it, is a problem. But racist pigs that continue to stand up for the confederacy and what it stood for are also part of the problem.
"If you were afraid of being attacked by multiple people, wouldn’t you pull out a weapon? Ultimately, I think that is why the charges are going to be dropped."  He got a teeny tiny taste of what it feels like to be Black, surrounded by cops (or White mobs), in fear of being attacked or worse. Only difference is, Strickland was able to walk away from a situation with HE solely provoked.
"Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color."  I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.    The big thing about lead is that it takes really high doses to produce obvious symptoms.  To some extent low dose exposures are not obviously connected to harm.  The whole subject is controversial.  Run your water a bit before drinking it to flush the high lead content out.
No reason this dark hour can't get absolutely pure black, with an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear capability. Timed for the American elections, that would insure that fear and hatred would rule the Middle East for many more years, and keep the insane branch of the Israeli right in power for our lifetimes. It would force the cost of oil to new heights, and thus make more billions for those with oil to sell.  I don't have a head for international politics, but even I can see the possibility of a new war, one with nuclear weapons on one side, and a lot of oil on the other. We need to remove ourselves from the Middle East, as we did from Southeast Asia. We have done nothing but help chaos and death, and even the Gods must be shocked and awed at our stupidity.

Fair enough -- I shouldn't have called your accusation "dishonest," and I apologize for that. I still believe that accusation is ill-founded, but again, agree to disagree. I don't expect to change your mind, but I hope that I might show others that it's possible to defend a point without resorting to sarcasm and personal jabs.   In fact, I do think it's possible to support both the NRA and aspects of gun control -- Wayne LaPierre himself supports enhancing our ability to restrict gun sales to the mentally ill. And I do think it's possible to be pro-life and support aspects of Planned Parenthood -- Planned Parenthood does much more than perform abortions, and of course it's possible to support their non-abortion aspects while maintaining pro-life principles.   My point is that portraying these issues and organizations as black-and-white does the debate a disservice. Sure, navigating these contradictions can get a little messy, but we shouldn't reject somebody for attempting to do so.
Brian, thanks for very well written, but also disturbing, piece. You defend yourself very well against protestors and some iconic straw-man "the left" who accuse you, ironically, of believing what your candidate says he believes.   Will your vote determined by some angry protestors and "the left?" I certainly don't call you racist, sexist, or ignorant. But I do ask, will you vote for a man who says what Mr. Trump says about Mexicans, Muslims, blacks, and women? Who ignores decades of foreign policy, and jumps to dangerous conclusions repeatedly? Who promises to deport 11 million people? Who would exclude immigrants on the basis of religious beliefs? You redefine him as "a fighter." Do you just disbelieve everything he says?   And I'd join you, whole heartedly, in objecting to the name calling, polarizing, demeaning, common-enemy tactics of those protesters.  ... if you weren't using them to defend a man whose campaign has ridden those same tactics to unprecedented levels.
Not a Trump supporter, but you're right. Just like a black man wouldn't expect to get a fair trial from a Klu Klux Klan member, Trump is right to expect mistreatment from a member of La Raza -- The Race -- sometimes called the Tan Clan.
tRump created the anti-tRump rallies, March.  Every time he opens his clap-trap he manages to create a new ant-tRump faction.  Glen Beck interviewed a guest that strongly suggested that tRump needs to be assassinated to make room for another rise of Ted Cruz candidacy; and Beck agreed.  How do you like those apples?  It's not just the Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos, and blacks that are anti-tRump it's a growing population that'll have their say in the voting booths; if tRump manages to make it to the RNC.
This is a complex issue with bits of truth on many sides.  In light of Edwin Coleman's findings, the assertion that black students feel "unsafe" in the building, if true, suggests a serious educational flaw exacerbated by today's negative emphasis on wrongs rather than rights (as if victimized groups don't have enough "real" issues to worry about).  Ironically, universities (with a few glaring exceptions - see Donald Trump's perversion) are supposedly established to discover and broadcast truth.  From that perspective, it would seem that keeping Deady's name on the hall could provide a valuable spring board for demonstrating how racism can be transformed into tolerance and positive social action - which is just what Deady appears to have done in his lifetime.  If delivered, that lesson could go far toward alleviating black student's concerns about entering the place and help to constructively recast campus dialogues for improving inter-group relations.
read the link - ridiculous.  cultural appropriation - yes.  but the culture it represents is not just black, it represent a lot of the precepts of Rastafari practices which is a philosophy and a religion - they believe the bible says to not cut one's hair, Hasidic jews also have locks down the sides of their head based on the same interpretation.  you could make the argument that the american  black population "borrowed" the style from the Jamaicans...at first being a statement of being mellow and in solidarity to the use of pot.... as did the white population at the same time, to make the same statement..     I went to see  "the harder they come" in santa monica in 1975(?) with a black boyfriend.  into the movie a bit when the rastas come on, he couldn't sink deep enough down into his seat - he was mortified...culturally , to let someone's hair get that way was bad.  then he heard all the white people singing with the movie and we both laughed... me at him and he at the situation.
The census data for 2014 reveals that 3.9% of Alaska's population is "black alone."  It also reveals that 7.1% reported "two or more races."  Of the dual race respondents 4.3% reported as black. But now we have the slippery slope of how much of a particular race must one be to report a dual race profile?  But more importantly the article lacks information about the racial profiles of candidates for judge vacancies.  Isn’t that important in deciding if there really is a problem or simply a lack of qualified minority candidates?
Building hotels outside of the US isn't presidential, it's business and running this country takes more than making money and flipping the bird at women, veterans, people of color, and people with disabilities.  "I also agree Obama’s record of disasters speaks for itself." Here is a prime example of your lying. I never wrote/agreed to that but you post it as if I did. You expect people to respect your opinions but when you openly lie your credibility and the respect of others disappears.
I would LOVE to go back to Africa, as the white people are prone to saying: if I could actually trace back the family tree through this ordeal back to the Motherland and find people I may be distantly related to. Also, it almost sounds as though you're saying that people of colour in formerly and currently oppressed lands should thank the white man for coming and saving them from themselves, the savage. It only sounds like that, right?
Great column but you forgot Mia Jackson @miacomedy at the New Negroes show. One of my favorite sets of the fest!!
"The USA would never let Hawai’i leave" sounds like the outdated mindset that said Blacks would never be freed from slavery in the USA or that women or Blacks would never get the vote. The people who think "never" are those who forget that they, and other human beings, have free will and responsibility for creating a just society. While naysayers, who uphold the USA as the almighty continue kidding themselves, we, who remember that we the people have the power, continue to push for change and continue to make it happen.
Shills; paid to say anything...and DT gets 25% of the black vote? Where did that come from? A DT press release?
Hey, did you see the video where these "whiteness month" presenters defended black rapists and said that white females were privileged to be the victims? In their own words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R224M6GcEaw
"LONELY as God,  and white as a winter moon, Mount  Shasta   starts up  sudden and  solitary  from  the heart of the  great black forests  of Northern California."        --Opening line of "Unwritten History", 1873, by Joaquin Miller,  former college student in Eugene's Columbia  College in the 1850s.  This wonderful book is dedicated to the Native Americans of the Shasta area  with whom  Miller  also lived in the 1850s, who inspired his deep love of Nature in this incredible region.  And may it inspire today's  well-intentioned students such as those from Alpha Sigma Phi.
E. David:  Your comments suggest you would have opposed emancipation for slaves and the granting of suffrage to women.  Afterall, the founders defended slavery and had the "right" to only have men vote. How do you feel about the Civil Rights Acts which deprived persons of the "right" to discriminate based on race?  I'd be interested in reading your response.   thanks, Gary
our first half white president?  black privilege?
The MIC is alive and well.  As an example, it is supplying much of the Saudi weaponry up to and including the jets bombing Yemen as we speak.     The MIC will also continue to do well on the big ticket items like your  aircraft carrier as long as there are people like President Putin flexing their military muscle in Syria and showing off Their new military vessels in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.  YOu do recall that there is just a teensy little problem in the Ukraine and NATO treaty members near Russia, do you not?  The Chinese building their island fortress in the South China Sea in land claimed by, among others, our ally Japan, will also keep the MIC healthy.    The North Korean nuclear threat is not going to go away by itself, either.  The MIC will continue to prepare to continue that war which is only in a cease fire, after all.
What if I identify as male?
I've probably read more news articles about the Trayvon Martin case than you have, Craig.  Martin was unarmed and walking home when he was killed.  His shooter stereotyped him all because he was black, out after dark, and wearing a hoodie.  End of story.  I feel sorry for anyone that's gunned down in cold blood; even if it happened to you, I'd have some sort of empathy.
Denigration of the first  black president? What a ridiculous comment Mr. Haycox. Why do you see color first? Denigration of the president is only because of his poor performance, inexperience, and the gridlock and divisiveness he has fostered. He created the Trump movement. What an achievement!
The country was ready for a black man to be president 7 years ago but made a terrible mistake picking Obama.. there were several black men out there who could have been great presidents but Obama was not one of them and his terms of distruction are almost at an end.  The Nation it is ready for a female as well but not Mrs. Clinton....the women is clearly a very evil person and  would destroy everything Obama has left standing...The Nation needs leadership and she has nothing but more division to offer....
What overseas business? A hotel? Trump wouldn't know what to do with a hammer much less managing people. Filed for bankruptcy 4 times and screwed the investors. He's a dangerous, misogynistic, racist peccary who represents the worst in American politics and you'd vote for him...  Enough of the "If he had..." rear view look. Obama's record speaks for itself. Your claim of incompetence is just sour "racist" grapes because you lost the leadership of this country to an intelligent man with black skin. Then along comes Hillary Clinton - your worst nightmare - to slay the paper dragon trump. Things are looking up!
In response to one of the comments here, accusing the person who wrote this blurb of trying to ruin the business discussed here is nearly as hilarious as the suggestion that they are angling for a coveted prize in journalism which would be and an unlikely event indeed should such a thing come to pass. Although the juxataposition of "historically black " and "gentrification" in the same sentence is unintentionally hilarious.  Basically the coffee/etc purveyor did not want to be associated with British Colonialism. I cannot imagine why they would not want to brand themselves with something that managed to ruin several civilizations and created conflict that continues to this day.  The outrage is curious considering some of the horribly racist and anti human things people do support whether unknowingly or just due to stupidity and ignorance
And here’s your quote of the day, from one John Ellis Bush, on Trump tweeting out a picture of him eating a taco bowl to honor Cinco de Mayo:  “What Trump did was so insensitive,” Bush told NRC. “First, not all Hispanics are Mexican. Secondly, not all Hispanics eat tacos. Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he already said, is a further insult. It’s like eating a watermelon and saying ‘I love African-Americans.’”  ​​ “This guy,” Bush added. “If we lose in November, we Republicans have ourselves to blame.”  Hard to argue with that, Jeb.
Weak of mind? Christians were used as candles in the coliseum, fed to lions and sawed in two.  No my friend not weak.
I'm commenting directly on the letter... hard to know how I could be much more "on topic" than that!  Is this the topic: "But let a white cop shoot a black criminal, and all hell is to pay." OK, is the letter writer calling Mr. Castile the schoolworker a "black criminal" because he has multiple tickets for speeding and driving without insurance? I think that is a purposeful mischaracterization of someone who seems like a decent guy.  Or this, "One thing is sure, however: White people aren’t going to go around shooting blacks because of it." That seems like a naive statement given the history of violence against blacks. One can hope, but "sure"? I'm not sure.   Are the attacks racially motivated? Of course.
Kind of like telling an african american that they are "making their master proud"....like you did here last week (and have since admitted to)?  Great example you are setting here!  And for the record, nobody is saying that "go back to africa" was said by the owner.   I would also not be shocked if it was a total fabrication that one of the patrons said that....seems a little far fetched.
Mr/Ms so-called Brown, I did not say anything about Latino nannies. Now did you come up with that kind of detail? Hmm.    You speak of an integrated school, but from your statement it is clear that you are fine with any or all neighborhood families being thrown out of Ainsworth ("redistricted") so long as you are not affected.  The worst kind of hypocrite is the one that does not even realize it.  BTW I am brown, so don't bring your racist BS argument here. Can you reconcile your statement with the fact that the Ainsworth SI program has so few minorities? Why are you so opposed to making the program more inclusive?
Because Black, no one likes blackness. Here's a link so you can start your own bog, er, I mean blog for free!   https://wordpress.com/
The offended tend to argue about speech as though it is all functionally and legally identical.  Using a university's internal resources, e.g. a web site, to express a viewpoint is not the same as expressing that view in a loud voice on the sidewalk or in a milder voice in the classroom.  Context matters.    Using the N-word in a class discussion of Huckleberry Finn is essential. It is impossible to excise one scene, in which a white woman expresses her pleasure that no one was hurt because only a negro was killed, and still teach Twain in a meaningful way, because the specific words are crucial to his way of pointing out hypocrisy. Using the same word out on the street in the face of a black person has no such purpose.   Most universities are run by the fearful today, and college leaders are unwilling to move slowly and carefully in responding to speech problems case-by-case in the face of political noise.  They instantly go to SweatCon 4 and flail about.  The result is usually bad.
Mike Dunham's request that we "give black soldiers their due" is a ridiculous one, at best.  This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.  Dunham claims "their role was severely downplayed," yet never once states how.  Are black soldiers the only ones who "suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?"  It should be noted that this characterized the life of EVERYone who contributed to the Alaska Highway.  Why not honor and recognize the Army Corps of Engineers- all of them?  Wouldn't Alaskans stand to benefit from learning about ALL the varied groups who has contributed to this great stretch of road?  Presentation ceremonies and park benches to only a select group is exactly the type of micro-Cultural appropriation that has will continue to divide this country- we need to identify these demands for what they are- and stop them.
You say you are not his mistress, but what is with the personal attacks by on anyone who does not support Fred Stewart?  You claims the writers are racist to report this story and are afraid to have a black man on city council?  What is strange about that is that not even the black community in this city support Fred.  Fred’s politics are more Donald Trump than anything.  He is pro gentrification and against gang outreach programs.    What would make you stay up to 2:30 this morning posting stuff like this on Fred’s person page (it’s public people, take a look for yourself Is this the sort of drama around your public officials?  If this is ok on his social media, would it be ok to say these things to anyone in City Hall?    Apologies to Mark Zusman, Nigel Jaquiss & even Nigel’s wife; but people deserves to know what to expect if they vote Fred.    This race is about “anyone but Novick” but look close and it’s “anyone but Novick or Stewart”
"Most all"? I don't think so.    It was funny thirty years ago when I first heard it, but there has never been much evidence to support the claim.  Most people couldn't hit the broad side of a LIO with a long gun, much less a pistol, and I've frequently seen people waving guns around with no care in the world for anyone's safety, their own included.  I've nearly been shot twice, both at ranges by someone forgetting to eject the last round from a chamber after removing the magazine.  Twice that I'm aware of.  Both of those times the weapons discharged; no one was hurt.  One guy who's gun went off while several people were downrange, actually laughed and the person next to him awarded him the coveted Black Eye of Stupidity and Failure to Know How This Danged Thing Works Medal.  Both were summarily ejected and asked not to return.       But thanks for your two cents worth.
Ah, pardon my misunderstanding--you're defending against my 'name-calling' of the CEOs of Monsanto, Texaco, Standard Oil, the 'Pebble Partnership', the politically-appointed 'economic czars' who figured it was OK to poison Flint, Michigan's tap water because 'they're only black people', the US business interests which demand we keep military troops in about 144 countries to protect them while they gouge the resources and labor of said countries, and all those bankers that precipitated the 2008 housing crash (which in turn sent the entire world economy into a tailspin).  My bad.  But since the inventor of fascism himself called his system 'corporatism', I don't think your complaint has much of a leg to stand on.  An accurate description isn't 'name-calling' except perhaps to the overly-sensitive, who think telling the truth is 'uncivil'.  And I refuse to be an unpaid censor for ADN--therefore I even mark Obomba's posts as 'good'/'civil' when they turn up in their little test.
You have no argument so you resort to deflection.  Of course anthropogenic habitat destruction takes the greatest toll on wildlife.  But feral and at-liberty domestic cats destroy 2.6 billion birds each year in the US, more than all other human impact combined EXCEPT for habitat destruction.  Your argument is no more logical that arguing that those Texas klansmen who in 2011 dragged an elderly black man behind their pickup truck until his head was torn off are not as bad as the da'esh ("ISIS") because the latter behead more people; or that heart disease kills far more than cancer, so for God's sake lets not DO anything about cancer.  That is what passes for the "logic" of your argument.  Anything else you care to add?
Go to this page: http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-ferguson-race-data  Then check the statistics on the table "Rate of Death by Legal Intervention Involving Guns" (this table is up to 2011).  If you look at the statistics for 2011, you can see that many more white people than black people were killed by the police (i.e. 2.74 per million for blacks, and 1.28 per million for whites - there is approximately 223 million whites, and approximately 38 million blacks in the U.S.). And as I said law abiding citizens don't count (or shouldn't count), even though some people like to throw everyone, including law abiding citizens, in the statistics to "prove" that people of certain races have more chances to get killed.  In most cases its about the situation you put yourself in, not about the color of your skin.  There is cases where the police have used excessive force though of course (against both whites and blacks and any other race).
The rapist was a Stanford student; his victim was not. The judge was a Stanford alumnus. We're looking at tribal cronyism. And lest anyone think this is confined to Stanford, think back to the local business owner who spent several hundred dollars getting falling-down-drunk at a strip bar and then drove over a homeless man before driving away and passing out on a freeway on-ramp. Our judge could relate to the upper-middle class business owner, but not to his victim so he gave him a sentence of a few afternoons of work detail for this homicide.  Such judges should be removed from the bench and possibly disbarred. If you can't set aside your biases you aren't qualified to be a judge. Sadly, looking at the statistics for our legal system's incarceration and execution of black males relative to their rates of committing crimes, a whole lot of our judges don't belong on the bench.
We could call this the fleeing white man law. As long as the individual making for the woods is of the Caucasian race, unholster that Colt and let the lead fly. Otherwise, wait for the Troopers.
KKK, you remind me that the only HONEST 'anti-abortionist' I ever heard speak was Tom Metzger, former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.  When asked his position on abortion, he said: "We oppose abortion for white women.  We are in favor of abortion for non-white women."  And that is the TRUE position of these white so-called 'conservative Christians.'  But unlike Metzger they don't have the guts to admit it.  And that includes 'Trumpy the Clown.'
So what distresses you the most, unemployment half what he inherited, deficit increase 1/3, the withdrawal of US troops from two hugely expensive unwinable civil wars in the Mideast, the repair of ally relationships from our disaster ours war on terror (especially the disaster ours Iraq War), or the fact we have a black man as president? Above all the guy has class, something totally lacking in a certain GOP candidate right now.
All of the high profiled black men and teenagers that were murdered in the past three years, Davis.  I have no intention of persuading you one way or another.  I see and listen to the local, state, and national news and formal investigations.   What about the shooting of five Dallas police officers; early reporting coming out of Dallas indicated that 2-4 snipers were involved.  As of early afternoon today, now Dallas is  reporting only one shooter was involved and not 2-4.  Media outlets trample each other to get the first stories out, triggering misinformation.  It's amazing what anyone can see and hear when bigotry and racism isn't involved.
In Alaska, grizzly/ brown bears hunt and kill black bears after they have denned up in preparation for their own hibernation. Scarface sounds kind of wimpy.
You might ask Ken about all the screwed up projects he was involved in that cost the state billions - like calling the kettle black.
Nothing is confusing me at all.  People born in the united states of foreign descent do not refer to a different country other than that of their birth as their home country. "Home Country" is the country of your birth.  I am not arguing that he was born there, only that there are a myriad of reason in which the Obama's have provided to give conspiracy theorist a reason to believe he might have been  born outside the US.  No of which have anything to do with him being black.  Now is that still confusing to you?
Might I ask for supporting facts on the number of evil white pimps as opposed to the number of kind Black pimps and drug pushers?  You are correct, some original colonies and colonists were sent west with grants and titles.   Such as the original Jamestown but just in case you missed it, there was a thing called the revolution where ties with England were severed so I am not sure what 'land grants' you are referring to.    Yes, a part of this Nation's history contains slaves.  Some of them from Africa where African people captured other African people and sold them to White people.  Yes there are many people today with poor living conditions, education etc which tend to segregate into public housing, living on taxpayer money, single parents, gangs, violence, drugs, riots, and violence.  Many are of African descent.    Virtually all of their living conditions are a direct result of liberal 'progressive' Democrat policies.  If the "great society" was so great, why have the gettos grown?
Headline says "whitest", article says "non-black". As we all know, there are more than two ethnicities in America. This is a pretty obvious attempt to push a misleading narrative. Alaska has the highest % of Native Americans in the united states.
Arrogant Kasich and lying Ted will never win.  Trump is exciting, but Hillary will win.  Trump wants to make America great again, like it was before it changed into a nation of clerks.  Clerks don't want jobs in factories.  Trump thinks he can take us back to the "good ole days."  But the demographics are changing faster than anyone ever imagined.  Having kids is too much of a liability for middle class white folks so the Hispanics are taking over through immigration and high fertility rates.  They are multiplying like rabbits so that by 2045 they will be the majority.  Adding 11 million illegal immigrants to the voter polls will help the Democrats maintain power so kiss it good bye, Kasich, Cruz, and Trump.
A key piece of information to add insight.  Michael Strickland was badly beat up at a prior protest involving a progressive of sorts, and his assailant was I believe convicted of this assault.                                                                                                                                  This said we could really use some kind of preparatory mediation between groups representing libertarians as Michael, progressives, and others to bring an understanding of how we will conduct political demonstration going forward.   Pulling a gun really escalates a political confrontation.  And it isn't even in keeping with Michael's own wish to be a citizen journalist.                                                                    Our politicians such as Pres. Obama are really failing.  They pander to Black Lives Matter who berate the police into not even policing places like parts of Chicago.  Then, he asks to take guns from people needing to defend themselves. Ug
Wavemaker again tries to write/speak in complete sentences. As long as she can say "racism" or "bigot" or "white" in a series of paragraphs she has the ability to pat herself on the back with her extremely long arm. As long as people like her continue to avoid the FACT that the people they are defending (???) are committing crimes disproportionate to their demographics, they are going to be killed disproportionately. Figure it out wavemaker. Do your math. You are a true fool if you believe cops, and especially white cops, are in some sort of conspiracy to kill black folks. Here's a crazy idea for the bleeding hearts; do EXACTLY as the police say, when they say it. You will live longer. I can tell you from first hand experience, 18 times to be exact. I might be/have been a POS. But I'm still alive.
I find it extremely hard to believe that the "drama" cause by Bernie supporters is the same or worse than the "drama" we saw over Obama. There were far more insults, hate, threats, and vitriol over our first "negro" President than there is against Hillary today. We're also seeing a whole new group of people coming out and speaking their minds. A lot of the people supporting Bernie are those who have just been sitting silently on the sidelines. Bernie is just making a lot of people feel like they have value and that they matter, and those people are really freaking out over it.
Hey, I must add you're supreme at non Sequitur, too! What is it with you and Black that you have such an ardhon for Native American's?
Pshaw!  Rush isn't racist--he just LOVES little black Dominican boys!
This is disgusting treatment of any student black or white, I don't think Adelman can be fixed, let him go.
Oh please! Explain Donald Trump then. He's a racist, misogynist, bigoted jerk who speaks for other racist, misogynist, bigoted jerks. And he's leading in the Republican party. It's horrible how black people don't want to die for not using their blinker or a busted taillight. The nerve of some people!
Oh, gay and black, you just caused all our white christian friends here to start salivating at the same time, for what I'm not sure.
The President goes on the air with a speech how the black people are not treated the same as White people. Do White people get preferential hiring and other entitlements, that Whites are not eligible for due to one single factor..... the color of their White skin? How is this treating everyone equal? obama has caused much more racism in America then any President that I have been around to witness. Things have gone backwards instead of getting better. The White house and the way this administration reacts has helped caused this issue to escalate to where its at today. People are not treated equal at all......we are all still treated differently due to race and color.
This sort of sexual, physical and mental abuse has been going on for hundreds of years when the Black Robed Jesuits first came to this land. It was their duty under God, to take the heathen out of the savage native people. It hasn't changed in all those years and it won't change any time soon! I was born and Baptized Catholic until I got old enough to know better. In all fairness though, the Catholic  messengers are not the only Religious folks guilty of such atrocities. I guess it just comes with the territory and it has to be handled on an individual level. If you don't like something, then don't participate!
The default position for some people.  "All black people are perfection personified;  any criticism they receive in any endeavor or field must be by racists."  Such color-linked sainthood does not exist in my experience.
Wow. A little politically correct racism?  I have never seen a white person.  Nor have I ever seen a black person.  We are typically all varying shades of beige and brown, some with yellow, red or green undertones.  Albeit it really appears you are the proverbial "pot calling the kettle black" with your comment.  We, as Alaskans, are all in the fisheries management boat together. No matter what 'color' our skin might be.
Ten bucks sez she's in one of those groups she labeled. She's just a contrary old bat. She sure gets under folks skin! If she gets paid for the comments she brews, she's a freeking genius! KK, RR, name some more... I had KK blocked on the other game. Life was good and I didn't have to scroll so much.
You brought up mexicans. So don't whine about my point nor complain about tangents.   Simply ask, rather than make assumptions.  You didnt even make the most logical of assumptions but a knee jerk reaction.  Are mexicans and Africans the only immigrants?  I didn't use the term so I have nothing to clarify.  But I bet if you used your noodle instead of your ego you could get in the ball park
So what has the Gasping Old Party learned since its 'autopsy' of 2012 (and 2008) - they continue to alienate women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minorities, Millennials, LGBTs, non-saber rattlers, people who care for our planet.  No Republican can win the presidency with a constituency of old, angry, Bible thumping white folks. The votes simply are not there in today's tumble of real world diversity  - one they refuse to acknowledge and embrace.   As for Lisa, she is increasingly speaking to Alaskans with a forked tongue while appeasing the GOP and her campaign contributors. Disappointing.
I think an American Indian should replace Jackson.  After all it was Jackson that committed genocide against Indians.  The Blacks never were treated as badly as the Indians.
My requirements haven't changed.  American white supremacist institutions are, and have been since their inceptions, inimical to people of color to a degree not experienced by the majority of white Americans, because those who control said institutions rely on them for military and political support.  They are a plague on the world.  Unions are attacked for going on strike.  Black folks are attacked for EXISTING.  They don't have to protest or strike to reap the billy-club, bullet or noose.  Their very existence, like that of Palestinians and Native Americans, is a "threat".  The kinds of malicious injustices visited upon Americans of color then and now has no comparison among white Americans.  If anyone is twisting anything, it's you, sir.  You're twisting history into a fantasy-land where nobody and everybody is at fault, and it'll all get better with a unified 'electorate'.  Are your feet wet?  And do you see pyramids in the distance?  I suspect you're deep in DeNile.
You should not be surprised after all libs are convinced modern day white people are responsible for slavery and should pay. Or how about the renaming of buildings or others wanting to scrap the constitution and bill of rights because some of the people signing were slave owners. Wonder if they include black slave owners? But you didn't really mean god forbid that someone should blame the shooter did you? You gotta know since it has been proven. It's his parents fault or the schools or those guys down the road. Where is your compassion. Sorry to clutter your good comments JetSetter.
I'd be more supportive of Miss Loretta if she'd said "why are there more Blacks in the system in the first place?" And "the frequency of the use of force in our jails is unacceptable no matter what color offenders' skin is".   Instead it sounds like the Oscars; everyone talkin bout boycotting due to the lack of "diversity" and honoring more "people of color", when really they're advocating only for Blacks only, not Hispanics/Latinos, or Asians, or Natives, who are the more discriminated against by far.
Got it. So African American kids born in the ghettos of St Lou or ChiTown are victims because of their skin color? Should they get reparations along with the poor criminals?  I had over 20 traffic citations by the time I was 18 right here in Eugene.  Got my license suspended. Went to jail for FTA. Ya. I got special treatment because I was a Ritz cracker.  Now you’re telling me I was a victim of discrimination.  Sounds like you got indoctrinated in liberalism real good at UCR.
Sorry Harkins, but you'er sounding like the anti-christ's son or twin.  Get outta here with your pussy, sabertooth blubbering.  Ssst.
I've been down around Bean's Cafe, Rhyner, and I see a lot of middle-age Caucasians mingling with the Natives, blacks, mixed bloods.  Hard to tell some of them apart.
I didn't see Jesse Sponberg in this video. @ 0:52, I'm pretty sure the gentleman peacemaker is black. Hats off to that man for putting his body in harms way.
Talk about sugar coating a story .   The million dollar question is :  With all the deaths in Chicago mostly being black on black crime , why don't we see Obama , Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson and Black Lives Matter there to protest all these deaths and working together to find a solution ?   When a policeman kills a person of color the marches and finger pointing begins.  Yet in Chicago people are dying by the hundreds---including many innocent by-standers caught in the cross fire , yet year after year after year after year  these people and groups look the other way .  Why ?  All lives matter , but since one group only points to black lives mattering---why aren't they marching in Chicago to end the slaughter ?  Why does the mayor allow the slaughter to not only continue , but to grow ?  Why not send in the national guard to go block to block to back up police as they get the illegal guns ?  One guy who attacked a cop caused a firestorm in Furgeson .  Why don't they care about Chicago ?
What does the SPLC say about The New Black Panthers ? I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely would like to know if they also classify  this group as a "hate" organization.
So you do have some logic here, but it has some problems. Take affirmative action for example. Now I think the civil rights movement and what it accomplished was one of the brighter moments in our nations history, like many liberals do. I even think affirmative action had it's place. But like a number on both sides of the debate, I  might ask how long we need to continue AA? Does that make me a racist for asking the question? Does that mean I hate blacks because I think other programs might create more equality? Of course not.  It sounds as though you are suggesting if we don't fully support all the requests of said people group, we are guilty as sin of hating them. Slippery slope in reverse? And no, we at Imago, for the hundredth time, are not scared (phobic) of gays.
Rodger Christie was one of the kindest men I had the chance to work with at the  Kona Surf Hotel on the Big Island when we were young and strong some 30 years ago. He worked long hours to meet his dream of being a farmer. Illness in his family and the relief Cannabis delivered his child changed his goals to include preaching about and praying with Marijuana. His need to do this in sunshine rather than darkness is why he was a fish in a barrel for the police net. I hope prison has not quenched his blazing spirit. And regarding his captors and their black robed masters; pray there is no hell.
HI DG!    I'm re.reading w/I wrote you & it's this:  "these ARE the people who show up when most others would run. they DO protect. they DO save lives. targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i’ll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or any person. eye for an eye? not the answer"  My take and I beg your pardon if this doesn't connect because I also thought that Icon and SD were saying the same thing is the focus was this contributors (the citizen) was so outwardly racist.  That said..  I think just showing up isn't enough....they applied for the job.  It is a highly stressful job no doubt but too many folks are acting out this guys racists words and that's what the focus was about.  I really appreciate your viewpoints DG/.  That shooting is worrisome just as much as all of the African Americans are being murdered.  I value ur comments DG. "
After attending a couple Assembly meetings I  am certain the members are interested in keeping the black market in business.
I have no reservations in opposing your attempts to control those who are addicted merely because you are offended by them and their habit.  Eugenics is precisely the same thing.  Those who intellectually 'knew best' and with the best of intentions ruined thousands of lives.  Margaret Sanger of Planned Parenthood and "The Negro Project", included.    She and W.E.B Dubois 'worried' that the Negroes would view it as genocide, but they proceeded anyway because keeping these women from getting pregnant was 'for their own good'.  Your tobacco plan is also 'for their own good' although it is also because you are offended.  Anytime I see someone coming towards me to do something  'for my own good', I will react with any 2nd Amendment tool I can find.  And I quit smoking in 2003; I'm defending the rights of others to be foolish, not myself.
Or how about the southern states where blacks still risk their lives to vote against the Republican Party machine, Donna.
Your "black on black violence" theme outs you, sir, the favorite red herring of the far right. I'd bet money you don't give a rat's a@@ about those lives. And since you asked, yes, sensible gun control advocates do care about urban violence, rural violence, all violence, no matter who commits it against whom. That's the entire point. For the record, I am a gun owner and civil liberties watch dog who believes that it's entirely possible to protect the 2nd amendment right to bear arms and still curtail the mass trade of assault style weapons. Watch out, complexity alert.
Expanding medicaid is a win-win for everyone in Alaska, for people with insurance and people without, for hospitals, doctors, and communities, not to mention the people who currently have no medical care.  This is just a local case of the virus afflicting Congress: namely, anything Obama does we're going to oppose.  Okay, there's black man in the White House.  Get over it.
The Hispanic and black voters will have significant voting blocks to keep tRump out of the White House.  Just because it's called the White House doesn't mean it's meant for tRump.  Haha
Oh my, another walking cliche.  Yes, I heard the chant to kill police - it was reported - not on your biased networks of course - their racism of low expectations on black people wins out.  Yes, it was peaceful until 11 people were shot. Are you that much a cliche?  Pearl Harbor was peaceful until just after 7:00 on December 7, 1941 - so what?  It was pretty ugly after that if you can read history.
I used to be prejudiced against Indians, then I married a Chippewa, I used to be prejudiced towards Natives, now I have a granddaughter who is Haida-Inupiat, I used to be prejudice towards Blacks, then I married one...The ancient Chinese philosophers believed humans become 10 separate personalities by the time they reach the age of 70...it is called maturing & gaining wisdom.
Your numbers are dead wrong. 40% of welfare recipients are white, 26% are black, and 10% Hispanic.
I don't know what 'black privilege' means, but George Soros record is clear for this election year.   "New York financier George Soros has spent or committed more than $13 million to support Hillary Clinton and other Democrats this election cycle, already more than his total disclosed spending in the last two presidential elections combined."  His son also donated $1 million three days ago through the Planned Parenthood PAC for Hillary.  (That tax free corporation has put $20 million toward her campaign, of course.)
Did the article not include the link to the full report when you made this comment? Also, why do you say that the graphic doesn't match the article? The graphic and the article both say that the average black adult is roughly six times more likely to be in jail than the average white adult in Multnomah County.
It was a different time and, let's face it, black people were treated "poorly" (the civil word for it) What did CB and Annie Mims do? Worked hard and bought not one, but two houses and raised their family.  Inspiring decades later.
You seem to be a black amd white thinker. What is this business of communism  vs capitalism?  Are you suggesting that tenuref track professors are communists? Seriously?
I suggest you do that very thing. My home computer is a cheap laptop, and resides in Betverton, Oregon and not NE Portland. I find if hilarious that you cannot accept that a white woman and black man can be friends without having a sexual relationship. This confirms your overal mediocrity. So, yeah, check me out. You'll find that I post from my laptop and cellphone, niether of which have ever been in Fred's house. LMAO...:)
because they ARE a hate group. they hate everybody except black lives matter, the black panthers, etc. but don't mention that here, your comment will be removed. its called civility.
Excellent, another example of America's shame, using people, along with great slights to its indeginous people, Blacks, and Micronesians in its Imperial Aggression.
I love how there are NONE of these critques for Taylor Swift and her bootleg brand of "Faux Feminism"...but why would there be? Only black women are subjected to such extreme scrutiny in the media...When we're not twerking for you or fighting on reality tv... everybody suddenly has an opinion. As for Ziesler's book (which was completely taken out of context for the sake of clickbait) the excerpts used were completely unrelated to "Lemonade" and don't seem to support this sham of an article.
"Let's get the black folks and the white folks at each others' throats"
I think you are pretty off-base here.    There is a deep history of city plans and policies doing systematic damage to a once-thriving black community in Portland.    That community was limited in their housing options and required to live in only one section of the city. It may not be significant to you, but it is to plenty of people who have a generational history here.        It's not guilt that drives some to want to redress some of the historic wrong-doings but respect.    At least that's how I see it.     I find it ignorant of people who are not of a particular culture to sneer and deride a group of people that they don't even want to understand.
I was thinking that too. As a White guy who "enjoys" white privilege, I am not in a position to understand Black Lives Matter like a person of color might. But let me try to explain why I think Sanders has been focused on economic justice instead of racial or legal justice. Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called "white guilt" and "politically correct"  to ignore this economic based discrimination. Sanders would say you cannot begin to address prejudice until the injustice of the economic system is fixed.  So he seems insensitive to the Black Lives Matter.
I had to smile and laugh at this; "...labeled us as less than human to white Americans."  I have always thought that calling someone "white" was "pejorative and not a self-designative term"  and in pretty poor taste.  Also, a lot of these names for people, places or things that trace their ancestry/history to the area we now call Alaska originate from Eastern Russia and the Caucasus area and thus not European.  Calling everyone European is not using "self-designative terms that local Indigenous people... would use".  Perhaps European-American, Native European or Caucasian would be more appropriate for those whining about being called Black, Eskimo or whatever.
The dog was clearly out of its property. Its body was across the property line, so the sonic fence wasn't a deterrent.  We owned a beautiful black Lab for 15 years who thought it was her job as family dog to rush the FENCED property line when people walked too close. A woman pepper sprayed her once because she feared Kana would come over that fence. Kana meant no harm. She was bluffing and she never went over the fence, but she was big, black and scary and the woman had a little kid with her. I could see why it happened. Kana learned not to rear up on the fence because of that incident.  We have since had a Lab husky mix who would and did ignore a sonic fence to intimidate other dogs. We recognized her as a potential threat to herself if not to children and dogs, so we installed a real fence of substantial height to keep her in.  The owners of this dog were negligent with the life of their dog. This was bound to happen sooner or later. Aggressive dogs should be fenced with real fences!
No. Just the white guys that use an 'African connotation' of the current President for an identity.
I have no problem when white and black folks dance in a circle when the Washington Redskins take on the Dallas Cowboys while others dance in a line or square. We are not mocking sacred dances as not all dances of Indians are sacred. Sometimes we dance just to be silly.  No one has a problem when I refer to white and black people, but the second I say the word Chickasaw red, to distinguish I am not communist red, and by golly PC liberals always call me a red-neck troll using the word red as a slur. This ridiculous nonsense is teaching red people to be ashamed of our traditions and culture.
What a loss. I’m so sorry to hear this. Short video: No Viet Cong. Called Me Nigger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd9aIamXjQI&feature=youtu.be
he is a pants pisser,   packed up his weapon and all his ammo and went out in search of someone to shoot because 'black people scare him' ............  a normal human being does not plan to 'hunt' other humans for sport and cheers from the racist right......
Eh.  Rush isn't a racist.  He just LOVES little black Dominican boys.
If she is a nigger, she isn't worth a flying fuck to Africa!
The context was completely left off. I was discussing how Colorado has experienced increased incidences of people experiencing psychotic events from accidentally overdosing on edibles and the impact on our behavioral health crisis programs. And yes we do that now but if Colorado is a good indicator the number and severity of incidents will increase.
From what I saw on the video......this career criminal and sex offender with a record as long as anyone's arm.....was resisting the officers. He had a gun he was trying to pull out and when the officers realized that, they told him to stop but he kept on making the effort to pull out the gun. Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.  Actually, I read on Yahoo that they did recovered the gun Mr. Sterling was trying to use. And also.....one of his sex offenses was against a child.  This guy wasn't no Baptist minister on his way to church but a career criminal refusing to obey a lawful orders given by a law enforcement officers.
You all are pedo loving pussys i know this comment will get rejected like my last but thats okay you still see it when you say it isnt civil. SHOOT ALL THE PEDOS AND NIGGERS!
I would be very offended by if it were called 'The Imperial East India Company'.  .. I take offense of the word colonial being used in an area that has been gentrified so fast and has driven outa diverse community. I know it's not the owner's fault that happened, the same way I wish I did not benefit from the genocide of Native Americans. Yes I still live on this land. BUT I am not disrespecting it by wearing a headdress!! There is a difference between doing something with respect for culture, and then appropriating something without thought to how it may affect others.   This is what their business has done.   If you want to open a business you should. But respect the context of the place you are moving in to. Have a dialogue with your neighbors. Don't  get defensive and basically make the argument 'I'm not racist, I have black friends.'    Sure, the owner may not be racist but the name chosen for this restaurant is racially and culturally inappropriate.
You obviously missed my point which is if we hold all Muslims responsible for the violence of the radicals, shouldn't we do the same to Christians that spew hatred and violence?
Old Soul:  Do you not remember the charges of racism that Obama supporters used and continue to use when people are opposed to Obama?  I am sure that this is what 40-20 means by 'black privilege'.   It is also the one that 'Black lives matter' supporters are using all the time.   It is also similar to the 'sexist' charge Hillary uses when you are opposed to her.   Racism is also a charge that minorities and liberals are rarely accused of when they demean white europeans.     Another question.  How did Obama earn the presidency?  It was not with experience.
Seems like a mixed bag. Without knowing what people are being arrested for, many of these numbers are meaningless. For example... if all the asians were arrested for trespassing and all the whites for murder, it would have a large impact on how you viewed the numbers.   It would be useful to see similar stats based on income levels, then compare the race numbers to the income numbers.  My point is that the less money you have, the greater the chance you're going to jail.   I have no doubt that being black probably adds a few percentage points on top of that, but the prime factor? I'm not so sure.  I spent my share of time with jail/prison/probation decades ago and I can assure you that the one thing almost everyone there had in common was a lack of money.
Appears it's the other way around, Black.  Too funny, bychatch.
Just as Bill Clinton claimed to be the first black president, Obama will claim to be the first trans president
I wouldn't make a recommendation to a client based upon an immutable characteristic of a judge, such as race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, etc. unless I had specific and real evidence of  bias. In a case like your hypothetical, I'd worry more about things like a judge's record on getting reversed on denying suppression motions than whether he was gay.  I don't give much credence to the old lawyer gossip you cite, which is just the same innuendo still applied by old lawyers to other judges who aren't white, old, heterosexual men.  I know lawyers who always bump female judges because they think they'll be unfavorable to men.  I also know lawyers who bump black judges for similarly baseless reasons.  It speaks volumes about the lawyer, nothing about the judge they're preempting, and they don't seem to get better results.   I routinely preempt judges who have displayed biases that their "lifestyle" would not telegraph.   Judge Carlson is more or less right:  little has changed.
I wonder if the local news channel will keep a "Clinton Baby-o-meter" 9 months from now like they used to after fleet week during the Rose Festival...   I've seen him speak in person, he's a charming dude.  Watch out ladies!
I had the same realization of the left and right in high school, eventually the extreme left and right parties will join together over a petty fear. So far the petty fear has been Black people, Arabic people, Hispanic people and soon white people, specifically elitist white people, which includes both Trump and Hillary. Already defeated by extreme left and right includes Cruz, Kasich, Carlson, Bush, and McCain.
True enough.  Alas, for many conservatives the world can only be black or white, and Mr. Trump is Dubya on steroids.  Not only are you "against me" if you're not "for me," you're a loser and stupid and (choose your Trump invective here).  Hyperbole should no longer be tempered:  Mr. Trump is a "leader" in the same vein as Hitler and Mussolini.  Consistently deprecating (and increasingly openly violent toward) to those who not only disagree with him, but are doing their jobs (or not) as journalists.  Not simply a cartoonish narcissistic blowhard, but a rallying point for the ignorant, angry and uninformed.  There will be violence, and worse, coming from the Trump camp, I fear.  The Republican party created this monster in 50 years since Nixon (both their racist, misogynist, homophobic "core" and the individual now leading them), and when you sleep with dogs, you get fleas.  They have no idea where to scratch, which is both gratifyingly hilarious and frightening.
Partisan voters,  what a joke you are trying to make,  looking at the videos most are black ,  Latino, or younger women, and most likely on some welfare program or another,  the organizers are most likely paid by the left,  Sharpton and the like,  they get more news coverage if the get violent and destroy property, shooting them is a little strong but if you just shot one or two of the thugs that are destroying other peoples property or attacking police it would probably discourage the paid protesters.
I'm not sure I see a pattern of racial discrimination in favor of black people in this country.  Do you have any studies that don't include cherry-picked items?
We're ALL biased.  We're only as aware and smart as the last data dump that hit our brains.  But what needs to happen with law enforcement is to change its strategic focus.  This is pie in the sky, but so was human flight at one point.  A criminal mindset was carefully crafted by specific circumstances.  We are ALL products of our culture.  That's why Americans don't speak French.  The old violent response to  bad behavior is still alive and thriving in our culture.  But you notice we're not putting a broken down car (criminal) into a garage (prison) and close the door for ten years and expect the inmate to be somehow "cured" of their criminality.  In fact they picked up some tips while rubbing elbows with the prison's 'finest.'  We incarcerate at a rate that is far, far higher than any other "industrialized" country in the world.  People do what they're taught, from an age so young they don't remember learning it.  Education frees all humans - black, brown and white.
I think what we need to do is enslave white people, let's say for purposes of their non-white owners' taxation and political representation that white persons count as 3/5ths of a person. Let's keep that institution alive for about 245 years, then whites can fight to end it, and then non-whites can  institute laws that segregate white people from the citizens--anybody who has at least one drop of brown or black "blood"--and whites can work for as little as possible for around another hundred years. Then the white people can undertake a civil rights movement so they can fight for "equal" treatment.  If white people have the audacity to speak up about what happened to their parents, grandparent and ancestors, everyone scoffs and tells them to stop asking for special treatment because the only non-white people entitled to special treatment in this alternate universe. White people live fearfully as law enforcement uses racial profiling and prison awaits a great many of them due to poverty.
All those right wing jethros n ellie Mays have nothing to worry about! With the senate n house of reps. Back east entrenched, there won't be any tighter or restrictive law(s) anytime soon..besides, we see way to often the ones pulling the trigger(s) are able to find n buy guns like going into a grocery store. After the tragic killing in Minnesota, the whites are gonna begin lowering the black population twofold by shooting n killing em for no reason at all n getting a free walk.  So for all the jethros n ellie Mays, don't fret about losing your right to bear arms...this is just another way for the paranoid white wing, I mean right wing to continue holding onto their false sense of being that it's their way or get shot...
If you watched the talk, by a very bright 13 year-old boy, I think you missed his point. Which is to take charge of your own education and find learning experiences that help you get to where you want to go, wherever you can find them. Jobs are disappearing due to outsourcing and automation. I think the future belongs to people who actually know how to do things. If you have skills you can apply them to self-employment as well as jobs. I've read that the founders of Microsoft and Apple didn't finish college. I once read a comment by a black women that went, "I've sat in college and I've sat in college". Sitting teaches people to be passive, not a good habit for the present moment in time. Time to think outside the box. Conformity is no longer rewarded.
The library requires that children have to be supervised by someone 14 or older.  Librarian staff and onsite security are generally good at enforcing this rule.  Not many elderly people visit the library.  If they do it's with a paid caregiver.  The children's library is located on the second floor across from the security guards' office door.  Can't get better access to security than that.  I think you're over-reaching on homeless fear mongering.  An inebriate can't do much harm other than fall down drunk and pass out.  They can't even defend themselves.  That's why a lot of them, men and women, walk around with busted lips, stitches across their face, and black eyes.
All I am saying is that your 'target acquisition system' malfunctioned.  You want to kill the people  who weren't involved and are trying to atone for the mess of others instead of the low-life scum-sucking dogs (to give them the benefit of the doubt) who actually made the mess.    You 'knee jerked' because they were frat rats.  It's sort of like saying 'all blacks',  'all women'.  You are saying 'all Frats' are evil just because they are frats even when they weren't involved.
When a developer wants a tax break, they need to be specific.  They also need to quantify the ROI for the taxpayer so a win-win can be reasonably concluded.  There should also be a reconciliation clause that would put the developer on the hook for lost tax revenue if it turns out they exaggerated the benefits.  Do you remember the claims made to gain approval for the construction of the Dena'ina Convention Center including moving the Sportsmans' Show and attracting oodles of national conventions?  We don't hear much about that anymore...
"Surrogate complainer"? Certainly not appointed...Consider being a principle at any school in Springfield, add the the fact that you are black, and dealing with intense scrutiny. An ugly side of education shows up as if ready for a public stoning.  One of my closest friends was a Springfield principle. After one year, she bailed into a much safer and sane job. It was, in her words, "the mothers from hell", who found  any resistance to their claims, right or wrong, fighting words.
The Gateway Pundit...the Tea Party Boys? They bought a bunch of phony info from a feedlot and posted a contrived photo of two black kids holding trump signs.  (The) "TGP has been cited by Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, The Drudge Report, The Blaze, Mark Levin, and FOX Nation".
After destroying virtually every panda bear, the Chinese come to Denali to destroy our grizzly. This is their territory, not ours. Humans should be kept out, and leave the bears alone.
You provide an unspecific example of some organization that supposedly doesn't accept a white member but of course you make no mention of the major American institutions that have failed to integrate (continue to practice discrimination) due to the fact that they are dominated by white people and promote their material interests: the American system of education, political institutions, residential areas (and don't claim that Blacks or Latinos desire to live in racially segregated neighborhoods because peer-reviewed research contradicts that claim), employment.  From the beginning and continuing today, is the dominant white culture that has instituted the division of society based on race. Race as a social construct was invented by European- Americans to facilitate their dominance of American institutions. Peer-reviewed research is conducted by persons who have obtained degrees from accredited institutions of higher learning. Learn something new, look up what "peer-reviewed" means.
Sounds like the police handled this situation well. There are countless and routine scenarios across America where if a black man answered the door with such a gun, even sober and not threatening and even without a gun, that it would not end so well. This is what white privilege (and gun insanity) looks like.
Upon learning of the "enormous extent of their contribution" black soldiers had in building of the Alaska Highway, republican lawmakers quickly asked to see it's birth certificate.  Thank you, thank you... I'll be here all week.
Eh.  All you've come up with so far is you don't like her hair-do and that according to you poor people on welfare bankrolled her into office, and the unsubstantiated accusation that she got her position because she was black (I'll bet you say that to ALL the successful black ladies, you little charmer, you...).  And you say MY comments are devoid of intellect?  To paraphrase a very popular Galilean carpenter: “Mote. Beam.”
How do you figure "irresponsible journalism," Hafer when bystanders videoed the take down of this black man by two white cops?  The man is tackled by the cops, forced face down on the ground, and we see a white cop pulling his gun and then blam, blam, blam into the subdued man's body.  The guy was hot more than a half dozen times in the chest and back.  You're a quick on blame journalism aren't you?  Let's see how you fair under the same circumstances, Hafer, and see if your opinion applies to you too.
You hit the nail on the head.  You can't on the one hand support police shooting Tamir Rice or any of the 100 other UNARMED black citizens shot by police in 2015, yet say that Finicum's death was an outrage.  Unless you are a...Trump supporter (new code for racist).
I agree. Trump will bring positive changes. Specifically he will drive a record number of women, Latinos, blacks, Muslims, and gays to the polls.  Positive change for America but not so good for the Donald.
Certainly.  Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, CDC and the FBI Census Bureau.  Police killings of blacks down 70 percent in last 50 years  In 2012, 123 blacks were killed by police with a gun  In 2012, 326 whites were killed with a gun  In 2013, blacks committed 5,375 murders In 2013, whites committed 4,396 murders  And they don't hit the news because no one cares about whites getting killed.  Simple as that.   Example, have you heard of Chase Sherman? Have you heard of Daniel Adkins (unarmed, not killed by police, shot dead by a black man around the same time as Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case)?
Mr. Robinson, even if we accept your hypothetical example as a realistic depiction of the present immigrant condition, which I do not, you misunderstand that "legal" and "illegal" are arbitrary terms that have been applied capriciously across history. Today it's the Mexicans, in earlier eras it was the Japanese, or the Germans, or the goshdarn A-rabs, or the Irish who were once categorized ethnically as black, not white. Congress could act tomorrow to make "legal" what today is "illegal"; how would that alter your views on who gets to enter the country?
White man speaks with forked tongue...  White folks are STILL fussing about the OJ case, as you yourself clearly demonstrate.  Where was all your fuss when Mark Furman admitted--on tape--that he routinely planted false evidence on black detainees?
This a waste of our tax payer money right now and sorry to say is not the root of cancer dilemma here or america anymore. When I was a child there were ads on t.v with Joe camel and the Marlboro man. If you go back another twenty teachers were allowed to smoke in class. Smoking was the normal. Now there is no smoking  In schools and so forth dont smoke In cars with other people who dont smoke And so on. Smokers in general are much more few and far between then back then. Yet cancer rates and even diabetes rates have more than doubled? And they keep going up? Maybe look to the real culprits next time. Or even better spend that money on the real crisis in Alaska. Our prescription pill, Heroine and Meth population is going through the roof. Little known tid-bit for those who aren't In touch with society today. When you give someone presc. Pills and then take them off it later if they are addicted they will move right over to heroine. Thanks Doc! #WhyDontWeDoSomethingthatmatters!
Wonder what the AP style book says about one person being called a color (black) and one person being described by race (Caucasian).
Poor parents, struggling to survive, are hard pressed to prepare their children for school or support them once they get there. I was raised in a family that went back and forth between working-class and poor, but was fortunate that my parents were readers, so I picked up the habit.   But not everyone is able to do that. A friend, who like me has a BA in sociology, had some kind of learning disability and found reading difficult. She is above average in intelligence but still does not read a lot, because for her it's work. For me it's play. I'm sure it's a difference in brain structure, that we were born with.  So many black families don't have resident fathers because women do not want to marry men who can't make an adequate living. I'm sure the same is true for poor whites. The problem is economic, not cultural.  And yes, it does make a difference whether we adequately fund schools.
A lot of us old folks grew up with Mayberry RFD, on black and white TVs.  Its great to be able to watch those shows again instead of all the reality cr@p.  Sure wish we could see some Fireball XL5.  Have you any clue what Fireball XL5 is about?
Ernie Black = Seattle troll.
Is the graphic on this article accurate?  It shows that average use of force is 57% on whites, 33% on blacks. ** So less on blacks.  It shows that taser use on whites 46% on whites, 44% on blacks. ** So less on blacks.
So you argue that the fact she is the FIRST black person to hold the Assembly Chair is of no significance whatsoever?  Why?  Do you also believe that ALL past Assembly Chairpersons having been white is likewise not significant?  Again, why?
i remember seeing Walton's red curly hair bouncing up and down as he navigated Saturday market way back when.  sure bill - you blend right in....   the guy is a character no doubt.  he is the ultimate "color man" of broadcasting - yes?  I don't think it's any secret Walton gets high - I imagine he's high when he's on air - would love to see his contract and it's clauses.  nobody loves any one announcer - turn off the TV's sound and watch the game while listening to it on radio if it's on...
So some little black bear, hadn't hurt anyone, didn't charge anyone, just enjoying it's day, killed because someone said they saw A bear that didn't appear to be afraid.  You know, I do t know what to say here...I feel sick to my stomach.  It's so sad, and even sadder is that this being's life has no meaning to really anyone.  They're not humans so if they MIGHT be dangerous/aggressive, it's death and death by being shot.  It makes me sick.
White Amerika is that portion of the population who have expressed their hatred of Barrack Obama since he became President.  The expansion of White Supremacist groups since his election along with the huge quantities of gun sales well-documented throughout the media displayed the evil underbelly of the nation dedicated to everything Old South Confederacy including Battle Flags and intimidation of black citizens with open carry.  The Tea Party became a legitimized haven for all of the fascist elements within the nation allowed to express their hatred for Obama and all colors other than white.  Every gun publication and the NRA fed the old fears of mass revolution against white citizens led by Obama.  The Bundy crowd in Oregon and Nevada used armed threats to dare anyone to stop them.  Finally someone did.  The insane purchases of weapons and ammunition throughout the nation serves only the profiteers in the industry and puts all citizens at risk from these fascist pigs.
A large part of the reason why education is so costly is because of the huge numbers of immigrants pouring into our country that don't pay taxes but receive public benefits like food stamps and education for free. Secondly, because of our "diversity" endless amounts are spent developing education programs and ESL programs for hispanic immigrants and other nonwhites which don't learn the same way (or at the same speeds) as the majority white students. Look at test scores by demographic in Alaska, for example. It is very costly to develop an education program for every group.
Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives. Statistics and facts. Just like when you say that black on black crime is what kills the most you are called a racist. As long as we allow the political class ( two wings on the same vulture) divide us we have no chance. United we stand.
You are doing an outstanding job Brian Black. Thank you for championing the good fight for transparency. And thank you Civil Beat for keeping us up to date on the progress.
Black Lives Matter
He's White so he knows what he can get away with. Be White: act like a thug, pull a gun on non-violent activists, get arrested, later released with court date... not harmed.   Be Black: gunned down by cops right away!
The one I mentioned, for example, Black Lives Matter.
Why do you use an African connotation to identify yourself? Can you point that out?
Why didn't the democraps ban guns when they were in charge of congress and Obama was president?  Because they don't want to!  They want to beat the repubs with the idea but in fact they are happy with blacks killing blacks nonstop. They are happy with terrorist attacks so they can advance their agenda dn take away more freedoms with each one.
Yawn. You think Hillary Clinton isn't racist? If you do you are a fool. She accepted a $20k check from the KKK for her campaign. She was caught on video making a racist comment about Mexicans. She went to a college costume party in black face. Get your head out of the sand! Mr. Trump is not racist. That is liberal lies!
Again with the "dishonesty." Sheesh. If you choose to interpret my attempt to recognize nuance as a "twisted rationalization for bigotry," then I think I'm finally convinced this argument isn't worth my time. I in no way support homophobia or misogyny, but personally, I'm increasingly convinced that the greatest "evil" in this world is the insistence that one's political and ideological adversaries should be dismissed as "evil."   It's a messy, (mostly) gray world out there -- I'd say we should spend less energy trying to delineate our enemies from our allies and more energy seeking common ground and respectful dialogue. But to each their own -- you do you, and if black-and-white helps you sleep at night, knock yourself out.
The Torys of England proved, once again, the failure of their ideological policies degenerating into racism and increased fascism throughout the nation.  Those left behind in the Tory deregulatory disaster are brainwashed into believing the problems are all caused by those nasty immigrants too brown or black in visage to be worthy of British citizenship.  Concurrent with our own national Torys(Republicans) whose descent into courting and appeasing the racists, fundamentalist christians, and corporate monopolists results in the nomination of a racist demagogue.  Corporate media stampedes the ignorant and stupid TV/Video generation into acquiecence for millions of dollars in ad revenue.  The American Demagogue's vitriol leads the headlines to cement his status as the Tory/Conservative ideal.
everyone knows you stay still until the officer reaches your window. you don't make any movements until they tell you. the officer is not guilty just following procedure. stay still if you are ever pulled over. you hunch or slouch or move cops are trained to take that as a sign of aggression or reaching for a weapon. so this was a case where the black guy got himself shot by being careless in front of police. an accident yes but a truly careless one at that.
It is pure Ignorance to vote just for having first woman president, in same way voted just to have first black president!
Shannyn suckered me in with her trip down memory lane .  I grew up about the same time as her---then she flipped a switch--just like these killers do.  First and most important , this guy passed the regulations to get his gun .  When I bought my assault rifle with my 30 round clips , I passed the test too.  The real fact is that gun laws won't stop mass killings. Look at Chicago where blacks slaughter each other by the dozens every week and authorities can't stop it. Black Lives Matter's don't even try . Look at the school shooting , where the kid took his mom's guns. Consider the stats-- over 250 million gun owners across America hurt no one last night , week , or year.  How is the NRA using dirty money ? I'm a dues paying member and I earned my money to give to them that they are using .  My gun isn't for a war--it's for an emergency.  If a group attacks my home , like they do across America when court rulings don't go a certain way---my home won't get burned , nor my neighbors.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/20/guns-on-university-campuses-the-colorado-experience/  If it is a right, then whether it increases or decreases violence is immaterial. And black people, and PDA's by LGBT, were divisive at points in our history. Should that trump the peaceable exercise of fundamental rights?
Thank you for this post.  Often folks look for simple, black and white, yes or no, all good or all bad answers.  The debate ovr panhandling is far more complex than Mr. Gerber portrays it.  If, in fact, we were providing the services and support individuals need to help work their way out of homelessness and poverty, we'd be seeing far less panhandling.  We don't provide the facilities and programs destitute addicts and chronic alcoholics need to work on recovery.  We don't adequately provide the assisted living facilities for the developmentally disabled.  We don't adequately fund communty based programs for the mentally ill.  Our lack of care and support for our Veterans is a disgrace.  Affordable housing is woefully inadequate.  and on and on and on.  Provide the support and programs our most needy citizens should be receiving and I'll be far more amenable to suggestions that outlawing panhandling is sensible.  In sum.....listen to the  DogLady...her message is important....
Charlie Black, who is helping lead Ohio Gov. John Kasich's delegate strategy, recalled working on Ronald Reagan's insurgent campaign in 1976 and struggling to court delegates as industriously as then-President Gerald Ford.  "People got to stay at the White House, fly on Air Force One and meet Queen Elizabeth," Black said. So, nothing has changed, right? What can I give you to get your vote?
Icon, thanks for reminding folks of the iconic  June 1 1997  Broadway Plaza "police riot" attacking peaceful tree-sitting protestors for which Mayor James Torrey  was largely responsible.  Being 19 years ago, many folks  here now may   not have not recognized the "Jim 'pepper spray' Torrey" reference, but it should not be forgotten.  A Black Day in Eugene's history.
This should make Black Lives Matter feel good.  This is what they were hoping for.
At one point in history the Supreme Court also ruled that blacks who "sold as slaves", whether enslaved or free,couldn't be citizens" - obviously they make mistakes don't they?
maybe he mistakenly thought it was a black man
No, she was the one who said this, "Looking at a young black woman in the group, I told her: 'I would rather be a black man in America than a black woman in Africa.' ”  The black woman said nothing in reply, but there was an acknowledgment in her eyes that she had heard me. Had she wanted to, I have no doubt that she was capable of responding on her own.?"   This is found documented in her article, "Young Facists COLONIZE PORTLAND"  She also uses her lack of class to say that there is still violence and "It’s home-grown, native-on-native."   Also in the comments section of her article is this awesome comment by her about wanting to vote for Trump to scare people--- I mean guys how can this lady be racist?! hahahaha she is in denial about it though.   I noticed this ladies name on articles before about this restraunt and googled her name. Enjoy her crazy attempt to defend herself after this garbage. http://www.heldtoanswer.com/2016/03/young-fascists-colonize-portland
I'm not a conservative, but I am ashamed to be an Oregon taxpayer supporting this nonsense.  Conservatives have it right this time - this is about so-called "white privilege", white guilt, white shaming.  It's divisive and insensitive and takes advantage of a double standard that makes it okay to say "angry white men" but screams racism if you say "angry black men."  No matter what kind of spin PCC tries to put on this one, it's still ugly and offensive.
Lana Ah Lan.  Kinda yes and no. Lewis, King, Hosia Williams and many others, Black, White, Yellow, Brown, Native Americans fought for civil rights in many different ways. Lewis was part of the Ghandi civil disobedience front. Your right to due process, in this instance, would involve Speaker Ryan slapping the hands or butts of the Congressional sitters which I doubt he'll do.   Yes, the American government can be considered a terrorist group for the massacres at Sacramento River, Wounded Knee, in Colorado as Pat Blair pointed out.  Prior to American Independence, the Spanish and British slaughtered many more First Americans. Guns don't just kill Gays.
Yes that's why I used a balanced example of a white transgender female political figure and a half-black male political figure.    The pinata was brought to class by a student so I don't fault the teacher at all.
I find it astonishing the register guard made no mention of Hillary Clinton meeting with that racist organization called black lives matter. It's tough living in a one party state.  That's OK if I don't vote I don't get those pesky jury duty notice.
There are a few things about your post that need pointed out,  there are not a lot of protests at Cruz events because he is not the frontrunner,  he is actually farther to the left than Trump,  check out the signs that are being held and tell me its Republicans protesting,  most are black , Latino or women and if you look back on clips of Iranians protesting the USA and burning flags  the anti Trump protesters all have the same look of hate towards  the USA as the Iranian protesters,  and would like to tear down the structure of America  just like Obama and his administration have been doing. It doesn't do the left any good to have the protesters destroying property and or abusing police doing their job,  all that does to real Americans if firm up the idea that they need a person like Trump in office,  time will tell.
What if you are 3/4 African American and 1/4 Alaskan Native ? What are you labeled? What about 1/2 Asian American and 1/2 Hispanic? What are you labeled if you are White and born in NY, White American?
Rogers, most excellent post! Rich is ALWAYS going to wiggle and squeeze himself through some insane wormhole to prove his point. He is bipolar: a solipsist that lives a perpetual simple syllogism. He's all black and white and right because he's the center of the universe.
Not Black. That was easy.
Drop dead.  Seriously!  You too Black.
Mr. Black, you are invited to read my comment above yours that makes clear the error in Tegan's representation of what I told her.  It was an honor to be the sole advocate for the 4 causes my candidacy made clear was the ENTIRETY of my "run" for the children AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF OUR CHILDREN.
Limbaugh continued  [To an African American female caller]: “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.”  “I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.  They’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well.  I think there’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn’t deserve.”   Limbaugh’s many attacks on Obama.....as a ‘halfrican American’, ‘Barack the Magic Negro’   “We need segregated buses… This is Obama’s America.”  “Obama’s entire economic program is reparations.”
I hope you surf national media outlets, Russel, because most political pendants believe that tRump can't possibly win without, especially, the blacks and Hispanic populations.  I'm hoping that a greater number of ethnic and organizational coalitions ban together and stop tRump at the voting booths.  I made several social-political predictions and they've all come true just the way I thought that they would:  US Supreme Court majority on same-sex marriage and allowing the Affordable Care Act.  Sometimes national domestic policy has to get bad before it gets better.  We had it bad under Bush and Chaney.  Whether people like it or not, President Obama DID make some socio-economic changes for the better of our country.
Perhaps that is true for Portland.   But I have yet to see a single panhandler in Springfield that was a person of color.  And I moved here from Eugene 13 years ago.  So many people in Springfield complain about illegal aliens so much, yet I never see anyone that looks Hispanic panhandling on the streets of Springfield.
Ms. Evingson, you'll get something of an answer to your question when they sentence that Alaskan Native guy who killed a sled-dog while driving drunk on his snowmobile.  Five'll getcha ten he'll get WAY more time.  Shows our 'court officers', including the DAs and judges, perverted priorities, to say nothing of their egregious bias.   Mr. Dusenberg's killer is the scion of a well-connected attorney.
Boozer, it's very charitable of you to point out that liberals don't lynch blacks. Thank you for being so open-minded.
Really?!?!? You had to go there?? Republican platform was to end slavery... Your point for me to want freedom??? Here is a point you may want to ponder, who was the first person to "OWN" a slave in America??  A black man, went to the highest court in the land and made his indentured servent into a life long slave. And that slave was also black. Not that ever implied my 2nd amendment thoughts and freedom to slavery. I bet you'll vote for any democrat for president
I believe the problem in Chicago is much the same as in most over sized cities. Too many folks and not enough jobs! To blame blacks for not reforming or policing themselves is an empty notion. No culture that I'm aware off, ever polices itself. Kind of the same thing that most professions won't police themselves either!  A crazy world, huh?
Yes Ivan. The hypocrisy from yes, the WHITE HOUSE, is rank. Our president, and leaders of "blm", Jesse Jackson etc etc have no thought in their heads to talk about black on black crime. Fact: Philadelphia's blm facebook is posting a "black only" rally so "we can scream and rant" about the injustices they are subject to. Hypocrisy. Fact: Baltimore Sun reports at least 2 black children killed in Baltimore by gang members, after Freddie Gray died, more by now I'm sure. No blm protesting. No "words of anger or condolences" from the White House. Only when it involves the police. The fella "selling CDs" and showing his gun to passersby wasn't really too smart was he? And the only comment the nation for from the Prez was that they are being disproportionately snuffed out by cops. Absolutely laughable, and unconscionable.
black markets dealers have also been known to sell heroin, coke  meth and prescrip.pills to kids
A ridiculous article.  ..."it was an existential attack on the entire LGBTQ community, particularly gay people of color." Ohhh Pleeease!   As  Xavier_Malcolm stated: "...we’re not buying into the drama of the BLT-GQ pity party."
You're right to point out that people of color are victimized by crime more than white people and that I have a privileged perspective.  I'd love to hear your perspective—if you grew up in the Numbers and want to write a post about what we got wrong, I'd be into that.  I'm all about facilitating dialogue on these issues. I edited both Tyler's Burnside 26 piece and Carye Bye's cover story about being an artist who is priced out and who doesn't like New Portland.  But I am not going to agree with you that Tyler's running in a bad neighborhood post was racist because I took the opposite point from it. I agree he should have chosen his language in the opening section more carefully to better convey his ultimate point. But it's also a personal blog post from five years ago.
Factual history seems to bother you quite a bit. Fascism is and has been a left wing ideology. Fact according to American progressives throughout the 30's and early 40's. I agree that there have been some right wingers that opposed left wing political movements, even sometimes violently,  if you will admit that left wingers have opposed right wing political movements, also sometimes violently. While we are at it, excellent dissertation about blacks, native americans, jews, etc. You are a very intelligent writer and I may not agree with you most of the time, you do write eloquently and I always enjoy reading your comments, kind sir.
Are you really that thick?  You certainly aren't that humorous.  You really believe that the only reason that Republicans wanted to see Obama's birth Certificate was because he's black.?  The fact his wife on several occasions called him Kenyan, he called himself Kenyan had nothing to do with? Good grief!
Bias and prejudice never really go away , they are just redirected  ! this is the same stubborn  human nature trait  that forced black people to ride in the back of the bus !   jb49
I was wondering who got the $5.00.  Sort of like a poll tax for access to the candidates, I guess.  Worked to keep those 'uppity Negroes' in the South from voting; limits those who can actually hear the candidates at the same time in Eugene as well.
A better headline is "Black man kills 5 policeman at Black Lives Matter rally"  Subtitle - "targeted white policemen".  Where is Obama's outrage over this?
Replace age 66 with black, what do you get?  A racist who should be driven out of town.
"Therefore, I support gay marriage as a legal right but not as a personal freedom for believers (just as I don’t support believers who engage in sexual immorality, greed, racism, pride, etc…)"  Your homophobic words are above.  And your prose smacks of seminary school- so I don't believe you don't care about the subject.   "I believe a biblical stance on LBGT would have a similar impact to society."  Wrong.  Since people are born gay or straight, being prejudiced against them is no better than the Book of Mormon denying the priesthood to non-whites.  Why do you equate beer and sexual orientation? Was Matthew Shepard killed for drinking a Black Butte Porter?
Self medication of mental illness is tragically discriminated and extremely common by ALL classes. Labeling people as high or drunk without proof is tragically stupid. Yes some may smell of alcohol/marijuana/meth but not all homeless people are addicts. The very worst and deadly of addictions is odorless and advertised by doctors. Many homeless have severe mental health issues with life long abusive behavioral problems or recent tragedies in life. This is a great idea and I hope it's open to all library members!!
Wait what?  Not committing any crimes?  You make it sound like cops just go driving around picking off black people whenever they feel like it.  The facts I read on all the recent killings where that the black men involved were or had committed a crime and were resisting arrest, that is why the cops involved were not prosecuted.   So they were not "just gunned down" as you said.   And don't think for a second that only blacks have been killed by cops, lots of whites have also (here again, involved in criminal acts and resisting arrest) even right here in Lane County!  Why don't you take an oath to look at the facts and judge each situation on its own and not just if a cop was white and the criminal black.
also which amazes me, his support is not from the wealthy...very few influential people have stood up for him, and a few that have, did so reluctantly.  how scary is it that this guy has so much wealth he can support a presidential campaign with little outside funding?  after going bankrupt 3....4 times?  what, with never a clause to pay his debts when he became more solvent.  "Hide"  his money somewhere?    it's everyman and everywoman supporting this guy, which is bizarre as trump has no care about them.  they are all trailer trash in his mind.  either white trash or what ..black...trash?   definitely brown and yellow trash.  why would anyone think he has an agenda to put the public's best interest before his own.  he's probably never done that in his life.       part of the problem with everyman and everywoman is they don't read and accept spoon feed drivel from the media.  why hasn't the media asked tough questions, pinned him, each and every time, show him to be full of the bull.
And I would like to add this: In the vast majority of cases (both whites, and blacks, and any other race) people have put themselves in a situation where the police had to intervene (which is not a good thing to begin with).   And in most cases they didn't do what they were told, instead they struggled. Law abiding people don't count in those statistics (i.e. can't blame them for not being criminals), the only thing that should matter is the situation, and whether a black man (or woman) actually has more chances to get killed by the police than a white man (or woman) in a similar situation.
We can partly blame evolution...the process, not the teaching of it. Evolutionary biologists deduce that "risk-taking" men are attractive to women because it infers they will risk everything to expend great efforts on behalf of the woman and the prospective children.
yes, it does. You keep avoiding the fact they reclassified pot as a narcotic more dangerous than heroin. This is blatant perjury. yes, opium was banned, the Chinese smoked it. These laws criminalizing drug use are as racist as they come. It's not different than when crack convictions were far more harsher than snorting cocaine. White wall street bankers snort coke, black people smoke crack. The laws are racist history from day 1.
Do you really need me to look up racial demographics to show you that Portland is less white, by percentage, than it historically has been? That's the only assertion I made. Is that what you meant?  Because if you meant that I should refute your anecdotal evidence with evidence proving the opposite, um, no. I don't know of any studies that have looked at "baseless accusations and chips on the shoulders of black transplants obviously uncomfortable in a town full of white people" which is why I'm not speaking for them.  Chum was funny! I bet you see yourself as a Great White Shark?
bless ms phillips who saw and recorded her boyfriends killing.  black lives matter.  white lives matter.   pink lives matter,.   brown lives matter.   red lives matter.   yellow lives matter.   young peoples lives matter.  vet's lives matter.  LBGT lives matter.  cops lives matter.  animal's  lives matter.  ----ALL OF IT MATTERS and none of it stands alone as injustice.   cop forces are interracial and i have seen a few black faces in these home recordings of police injustice.  i feel for those guys - are they black men or cops first?  i don't know what the answer is to this horror.  i have both black relatives and a bad cop relative in the chicago area. my heart freezes every time there is a shooting there.   i have lost a cousin to gang bull sh*t and  they didn't use a gun on him... it was a black on black crime whose press coverage was an obit.  if he had been white - probably near the front page.   the bad cop?  he has his day coming.   cop or not - matter of time.
0.013 per cent Black; 0.078 per cent Hispanic;  and 0.135 all other minorities.  And so the headline reads "Black Lives Matter".    Apparently they matter more than all the other minorities for some reason.
Blacks oppress themselves...
Awww Geeze. they even have an illegal alien giving the presentation. White shame month. How wrong is that? If you don't know much about PCC I can tell you the men hating lesbians run that place along with a bunch of "guy" with long hair and earrings. No wonder this school has a less than 7% success ratio. What a scam! All those student loans and the paper isn't worth squat. Our country is in bad shape. I'm going to vote for Trump and hope he will deport that lying criminalien living in the fantasy world of PCC.
The purpose of gay rights laws is to protect gays from being discriminated against .  They fear losing jobs if someone finds out about their chosen lifestyle.   It's wrong to fire someone because they are gay.  But, why is it ok to discriminate against those who don't support that lifestyle ?  Tolerance is demanded by gays and their supporters---or else . In today's Dispatch it was reported Curt Schilling was fired because of a picture he posted on his facebook account showing how if anyone complains about a man dressed as a woman using a woman's bathroom---they will be called a bigot. Blackhawks player Andrew Shaw was just suspended for using a gay slur.  Why is ok for gays and their supporters to use slurs , but wrong for normal people ?   Why is ok for blacks to use the N word, but whites will  get fired for it . No one should call anyone names .
We could highlight his racist attitudes as exemplified by the things he's said but almost everyone has heard or read about what he has said. Maybe it would be better to focus on his actions that have caused actual harm to minorities, for example, his real estate companies refusal to rent to African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, "the Trump Management Corporation settled the original lawsuit two years later and promised not to discriminate against black people, Puerto Ricans or other minorities.... Later..."the Justice Department sued the Trump Management Corporation again for allegedly discriminating against black applicants by telling them apartments weren’t available....Workers at Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City...have accused him of racism over the years. When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle..." Here Are 10 Examples Of Donald Trump Being Racist--Huffington Post
Incoming freshmen are an interesting group to study.  Nationally, only 43% of white and 21% of black freshmen will graduate from college.  I wonder who in the administration is sharing that message with the incoming class?  Know before you borrow.
For argument's sake, assuming you're right that blackface is acceptable social behavior, that wouldn't invalidate her point that probably most people don't think it's okay. Her point was that if we were to use society's general acceptance of a behavior as a litmus test, blackface would most likely fail while sombreros would not.
This is why you have the BLACKLIVESMATTER movement and the N.A.A.C.P. and the Urban League.   Non-Whites should NEVER expect justice from the dominant culture.     You MUST protest, agitate, and demand fairness and equality.
Wonderful piece! I love your honesty and examples of what girl scouts has meant to you.
Is asking people to vote for you because you're a woman msewxism??  I wouldn't call it "sexist",  here's a definition for you:  Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect any gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.[1] It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles,[2][3] and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.[4] Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.[5]  from Wikipedia   I think most Blacks would be happy to settle for "equal" treatment.  That "special" treatment you reference is likely "affirmative action."  That's a whole different issue.  I'd enjoy discussing it with you some day.  Give me a call if you're interested.
ali stated his objections in plain language.  he was not a chicken-hearted draft dodger like cheney and his bff sock puppet george bush.  'i ain't got no quarrel with the vietcong...no vietcong ever called me nigger.'    - the champ
Obama without any question will go down in history as the president who turned back the clock once again to a divided nation not seen since the 1960's over racial tensions of black vs. white in America. Obama is a RACIST and anyone who says otherwise is either a damn liar or a bigoted racist ilk of Obama. People in my neighborhood are already planning on a block party to celebrate his last day in office!
I hear you supporting free speech -if it matches your own opinion.   You want to have your own harsh criticisms in the name of 'free speech', but you are quick to label dissent as evil in uncompromising terms, (like parasites)  ====== It's hypocrisy that liberals have had to deal with as well.   What do you do with a Nazi, a violent student movement, a white supremacist group that hasn't killed.       Rightly of wrong, liberalism, (look at the ACLU), has allowed even the most repulsive of comments to be made.  You are wrong in labeling all liberals as intolerant of conservative, authoritarian, even fascist speech.    Liberals, like conservatives, CAN be ultra defensive of their view points.   But real liberalism allows dissent to be voiced.    Liberals and Conservatives  who use stereotyping to describe friends and foe, are showing their insecurity about accepting real free speech - more accurately, free thought.  Write on.....
Lol last comment gone ill post another revised one here goes   Another NIGGER running around robbing stores and getting away with it... I am not shocked. Delete this one too doesnt change the amount of niggers doing dumb shit it just makes you a nigger for infringing on my freedom of speech.
I partied at Beer Can Lake!!! It had leeches, if I recall...anyway, I have High Street from Kodiak! A good one, the old time black with silver outline and letters.
Rosenblum’s behavior in this matter is inexcusable. I don’t care what the skin color of these Oregonians may be.  The state, without authority, is spying on Oregonians because they expressed a political idea.  People may disagree but it seems to me “Black Lives Matter” is a plain, friendly thing to say that is hostile to know one. The original incident is bad enough.  But subsequent behavior – including this delay -- has shown a pattern of deception.  She just wants voters to forget what she has done. I won’t.
Gunalchéesh! [Tlingit], Thank you [English] ... In accordance to measure, HR 4238, [The measure struck the terms Negro, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, Indians, Aleut and "Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent" from those laws and replaced them with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Native American and Alaska Native.] As an Federal Recognized Tribal Citizenship, Alaska Native, I applaud this action by our assigned Federal President of United States which governs our Federal Lands in our States.  Have a bless day, readers~
Last patriot - yes it DOES matter.  The black shooter said he wanted to shoot some white cops. Obama's outrage is missing here
I think you're missing the point, Freddy. In fact, you've proved my point all too clearly. You made this about Race and side-lined the issue altogether. Something our Country is becoming all too well practiced at doing.  I will challenge you with this question, if a child is 50% Alaska Native and 50% Black, what race are they? How about if they are 25%? And 12%  You will probably say something along the lines of, "Whichever they identify as" --that seems to be the common trend these days. I would challenge you instead to identify them as Americans. Period. Maybe then we could start to make some real progress-- as a country, and a Race-- as in the Human Race.
Not mental illness. A young man who refused to clean up his act after getting caught and on parole. He knew what his responsibilities were and decided that he would do what he wanted. To get blind drunk. He murdered this girl. Drunk blackouts be dammed. Now another life is in toilet because of his spoiled self-centered determination to drink, knowing he was forbidden by courts. Irresponsibility isn't mental illness. Selfishness isn't mental illness. Being on parole and getting blackout drunk isn't mental illness. He has a total lack of not caring about anything but what Joshua wanted. How's that working out for him?
there shouldn't be "white" interests or "black" interests but American interests.  It is an American interest to limit immigration to the needs of our nation, not the needs of the immigrant regardless of that immigrants race.
The Mat-Su valley is simply trying to hide their ill gotten gains from the state by keeping a black market.
Tom: The Southern Poverty Law Center is the leading organization for tracking racists and hate groups in the USA, outside of the FBI.  And they list the Nation of Islam as a racist group that spreads hatred.  And Ali has been a member ever since 1964.  They are an extremist fringe sect of Islam with less than 40,000 members.    So it is not I that is judging the Nation of Islam, the Southern Poverty Law Center is.   Just read what they say about the nation of Islam at the link I have posted:      https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam  Here is quote from their description of NOI:  "The Nation of Islam's theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate."  I guess that you are OK with their bashing and denigrating of LGBT people too.   I condemn all hate groups listed on the SPLC website.   Do you???
Nearly all the posts in here sicken me. This is a watershed moment of violence... I can't even tell from a headline if "police shootings" refers to the senseless killing of black people or the senseless shooting of police. Is this the time to fall back on easy sound bites of "blame the NRA" or  Obama's "race baiting" and "the police acted stupidly"? I don't know how making posts like those seem like a good idea in the face of a complex tragedy. It certainly is not as simple as either Ward or you make it out to be.
And yet he's still alive.  Amazing isn't it? Just like the white guy in North Carolina who was waving his gun around and shot twice at a cop.  These white guys with guns never end up dead on a slab.  Proof that cops are choosing to execute black people. #blacklivesmatter
> A less sensational headline would be “Black people violate their parole and probation terms 11x more often than whites”  How would that be less sensational? First of all, the premise is inaccurate--it's not true that black people are violating their probation/parole at such higher rates, but rather that the average black adult, taken from the population of all black adults in the county, is 4.1/7.5 times more likely to have violated probation/parole (respectively) than the average white adult taken from the population of all while adults in the county. The rates at which each population violates probation/parole *they already had* are much more similar.  Also, you can't just add rates like that. That's not how math works. The headline you suggested would be a gross misrepresentation of the data.
Senator Sanders has been a mayor and a Senator for a relatively short period of time.  Some of his arguments about judgements on legislation  and the idea that people don't make mistakes and even take responsibility for them is flawed.  Innuendo's used by his campaign are fraught with misinformation and misleading statements. No Senator is allowed to make money from making speeches. If you're a woman who has been required to do more than men are required to do in situations and there are no rules in place to demand you do it, all women would be ticked off.  Heck Senator Sanders said when he was on the campaign trail sometime ago on the west coast the families taxes would be shared in a day or so.  But his taxes weren't shared, and this years taxes weren't done close to deadline.  Secretary Clinton shared 30 years of taxes immediately. Taxes seems like a small issue but don't call the "kettle black", it you don't follow some fairly easy requirements. Not beneficial to be stubborn.
Somebody must call a spade a spade.  “When current black students feel unsafe to walk into Deady Hall..."  In view of all the positive life actions of Deady as enumerated above, I conclude that those students who feel unsafe walking into Deady Hall are mentally disturbed.  Or perhaps the students are just being disingenuous and misrepresenting their feelings to achieve a political objective.   I have little sympathy for those who attempt to manipulate us to achieve political objectives especially when they invoke notions of safety where there is no rational danger.  Can any rational human attribute danger to entry to Deady Hall that is related to the name of the building?
Really we have a person trying to do some thing great and rebuild put America on track again and these negative reports keep coming out on Donald Trump. What has the nigger in the White House done that is great? Bill Clinton what he done to all of his interns that worked for him the sexual abuse, and Hillary destroyed destroy these young Ladies. Bill & Hillary millions of dollars taken from foreign countries. Why did Obama & Hillary want Amb. Chris Stevens and others killed? Obama & Hillary had Kadafi in Libya murdered. They over throw Egypt leader and put Muslim Morsi in power and gave him 8 Billion taxpayers money. Now Egypt over throw Morsi and put him in prison because of his Muslim beliefs. Really now America you want this corrupt woman as President.
When the Blacks and Hispanics vote en masse for Hillary that is racism.  This next election is all about race.  Whites have to vote for Trump to balance the election.  So let's not kid ourselves.  Obama brought this on us.
Okay icon, if he really said these things, they reflect badly on him.  Given the intensity of dislike for the man, however, can we trust these recollections?  I just googled the laziness quote and found:   "Laziness is a trait in blacks."  "That line, however, is not directly from Trump. It is found in a 1991 tell-all by a former Trump employee, who alleges in his book that he heard Trump say those words to a black accountant at a Trump-owned establishment, according a 2011 article in the Huffington Post."  When a person does not like another, vindictiveness comes easy.     Thank you for your civil comments and please have a good day.
So when White police officers shoot black criminals the headlines always mention White people. This Cop killer was a black murderer but the headline now wants to say he was a Army vet and does not include he was black. Why is this? We all know why ADN.......
Donating large sums and dictating policy are two different things. And you are a bit of a dissimulator, aren't you? The lady was put on leave because she used the n-word while delivering a rant about how black students' graduation rates were not tied to a racist environment. This instructor had far more to say, as well, that is controversial.  Taken in context, the word easily can be understood to be aggressive, demeaning, and insulting.  Accountability has nothing to do with tenure; deans and others have ways to spur instructors if they're loafing. The critical question is independence. This war on tenure is nothing but another rabid right assault on progressive institutions, in this case, universities.
No I do not think it was racist, Since Obama got in control white man can not say anything, but black people can say any thing and it is okay, like put Cops in a blanket fry them like bacon.
I find it funny to watch the Republican party wake up the fact that they have had 'Trump followers' all along.    Trump did not create the angry white male, they've been voting for Republican candidates for decades.     Cruz will not create evangelicals, but he knows their language and their side of issues.     For a couple of decades   The Republican party has enjoyed the conservatism that comes with libertarian, anti-authority character types.  Leadership loved the fact that they can sell the concept western capitalism, lacking all moral or ethical standards, should be the guiding principle of the country.   It's like the David cheering for Goliath.   More power to them, the Democratic leadership had their hands in the till as well, so the resistance was light.  This is not the Republican party of old but if it's causing them problems they've had at least a good 24 year role.  It's been a GREAT year for Independents who are asking for a new design in American politics.
I think its very possible that every culture has and experiences racism on some level.  Whether white or native, or black or Indian.  I believe that to overcome something that on a basic level is a mental disease it takes an entire society.  Its important for people to realize that not just one culture experiences judgments based on their looks, culture or race.  We all do.  I hope that more people teach their children not to be affected by racism but more so that they teach them not to judge others based on race, culture, or looks.    The ideals of "don't judge a book by its cover" should be spread more often.
Excellent comments.   I have really struggled with 'social norms' through my life.  Like most young people there were a lot of 'normals' that I didn't like or want to become.    But life teaches some lessons over time, my attitudes have changed and probably will again.  Societal norms can mean a lot of things.  It was a society norm when I lived in Houston as a child, that you didn't really see black people in your neighborhood or in your life, tv, radio, anywhere unless you crossed some boundaries.   The norm breakers, those that refused to accept the 'normal' of racial discrimination were hero's to me.      Just saying that norms are made to be broken.   ;-)
Hillary's demographic strengths seem to be old men, old women and black voters.  Bernie's got the younger Democratic crowd.  SuperDelegates were invented to keep people like Bernie out after Mondale was beaten so soundly by Reagan years ago.  I'd bet money that the Oregon SuperDelegates are already pledged to her.
If you really want to know why so many Native children are inappropriately being ripped out of their homes and villages, Black, it's because state OCS doesn't care diddly about cultural competency.  That means a social worker, generally white, goes into a Native home and stereotypes that the home is unfit because it doesn't have a bedroom for each child, there's no white picket fence, and the bank account has the appearance of paycheck to paycheck.  The OCS worker overlooks the fact that many of the Native children are loved, happy, and enjoy living with there parents, aunties, uncles, and grandparents.  A child's happiness generally doesn't factor in when OCS makes their inspection.  I'll bet that if OCS came to your home to license it as a foster home, you wouldn't pass their smell test.  Bet  me money.
Bigot, racists birds of a feather flock together huh Black?  Go peddle your hate somewhere else.  The KKK lives in the Lower 48.  I'm sure they have an opening.
Holy cow, what comment sections are you reading where Harriet Tubman gets called a nigger "throughout" them?! I'm sure it's out there somewhere but every single one? One would be too many, but I still call bullshit. Good points in your article, tho.
This is a very succinct and completely accurate assessment of the current situation. Not to diminish the credit of the writer, but his judgement is so blatantly obvious to the level headed observer, that it almost doesn't need to be said... except that it does need to be said. Too many people in this country have lost the ability to be level headed. Instead, they are carried away with irrational hatred of a black president who've they've erroneously labeled as a socialist.
What happened in Furguson ? What happened in Baltimore last time ?  The mayor even ordered the police to stand down and let what group burn down the town ?  I'm a law abiding person and it ticks me off when one group gets away with looting and destroying property nearly every time they feel justice wasn't fair.  Why does only one group of Americans feel they are justified in mass looting and destruction of property every time things don't go their way ?  Why do you call me a name for stating the obvious ?  In New York Black Lives Matters people were chanting they wanted police killed.  Obama told the nation " police acted stupidly " in the D.C. case which was code for all police are bad or to be questioned.  He implied they weren't the hero's they are for keeping us safe. How does stealing TV's and everything else they can grab like a pack of rabid dogs ( have you seen the security tapes ? ) make up for a a court decision they disagree with ?  What do you call them ?
I see the point in this but I've also seen Native American children ripped from loving caring foster homes who wish to adopt them and give them a permanent home with family - just to place them with a foster family who happens to share their ethnicity?  Of course you rarely get much follow-up by the media but common sense tells me this helps no one and only serves to emphasize the very intolerance for each other we are trying to get rid of in this country. I'm part Creek and I know if another Creek child who was in a foster care situation with a family of white, black, green or whatever people who love him or her and want the very best for them in their lives that part of that would be helping them understand who they are and where they come from. I don't think these children are being "converted" from Native American no more than an African American child in a loving white or other  hone would be converted. So what exactly are we protecting? Isn't the point to get these kids in homes?
Who still believes all that gateway drug propaganda? Only people who've not been keeping up.  The states that've passed the most liberal drug laws are doing just fine.  Legal drugs do not draw organized crime. It is black-markets (markets for illegal goods) that draw organized crime because that is where the big profits are for the ruthless.
powerful words - D.C.:"'LONELY as God, and white as a winter moon, Mount Shasta starts up sudden and solitary from the heart of the great black forests of Northern California.”–Opening line of “Unwritten History', 1873, by Joaquin Miller, former college student in Eugene’s Columbia College in the 1850s"  so how do you deface, defile and disrespect such a majestic place?
This is not the "worst mass shooting in US history". Sandy Springs Massacre Colo. 11/29/1864, US Militia killed and mutilated 70-163 Cheyenne, 2/3 women & children. Wounded Knee Massacre, South Dakota, 12/29/ 1890, 150 Lakota men, women, children murdered by US military. Today's massacre is an indication of an American society whose answer to differences is violence, whether Obamas Drone Murders, police shootings, school massacres, church shootings, now this. In my long history on earth, I was hoping for a different society after WWII. But it has just worsened.In spite of Black Coffee's living in a myth about AMERICA, we really are not a good society. So perhaps it is long past opening the discussion to what is a good society?  We know that all of America's expense on weapons, invasion of other countries has not made us good or safe. It has only brought greed and resentment.
The article is not saying black people have a higher rate of parole or probation violations. It's saying that when they do have a violation they are jailed much more often than white people who commit the same violation.
As an African American I am gleeful to have the choice of using Uber or Lyft as an alternative to cabs that has a pathetic history of not picking up people of color...
How is this statement not racist?  If you are talking about the South in America, there are many more Black people than there are in this state established with the intent to exclude Black people from living here.  Please clarify what you meant to say.
This is why desegregation was a terrible idea. Black people are pack animals, still too much monkey in their DNA
Ernie Black, in a way you're right with your comment, "choose not to break the law and end up in prison". I agree totally. In the case of Kirsten Simon, she was picked up for missing a PO meeting, a prior drug related arrest. She had been desperately trying to get into a  rehab center. And she was terrified to go to prison. Because she thought she'd die there.... Im not minimizing drug use by any means, its truly a scourge, but  my stepdaughter Kirsten came about it her addiction the All American Way, to manage severe pain. About her: she was a generous young woman who'd help others who were struggling. A young mother who worked very hard to support her family.  But regardless of Kirsten's story, what happened to her in that cell is a far greater crime than her missed PO appointment. No one should suffer this type of brutality. (Her father was warned to not look at the surveillance video, he didnt).
"If I was racist I wouldn't live in the neighborhood." Ha. That's exactly the kind of logic that Kristina Wong disproves here. Brought to you by the makers of "my best friend is Black" and "I treat my housekeeper like family"! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6hD7XFW0is
I think you believe that about secularists (whoever the heck they are) because you define "diversity" as including (or even celebrating) those who would discriminate against others based on some quality.  For example, when we are commenting on the cake bakers and the gay couple, you (or your identity at the time) wrote that you would be fine with a shop keeper discriminating against Christians or gays or Jews or blacks or whoever because, you know, freedom and honoring diversity.   One can honor diversity but still push back against bigots.
Are there black people addicted to heroin dying in prison in Alaska? Can you cite a single example? Black folks have a sophistication about heroin that suburban white kids lack. Not only that but if they did do a story on a young black girl who died in prison it would be decried as "reinforcement of negative stereotypes."
Christopher Mercer who killed all those students at the community college at Roseburg Oregon October 2015, was just as black as Barack Obama.
Brownback was reelected because:  A.)  The "Negro" was not on the ticket, in a non-presidential year, which lowered the Nativist fever level and the turnout. Kris Kobach helped, disenfranchising tens of thousands of minority, student and poor voters in Koch-fueled hysteria. B.)  People knew how dangerous Sam, "The Family" man was, but his excellent opponent had been caught getting a (legal) lap dance at a strip club 17 years earlier, brought there by a partner in the firm he had just joined. Nothing illegal, of course, and now married, with teenaged girls, the Republican Governor's Association ran ads against him every 15 minutes about how he was a supposed pervert.  Thomas Frank had called it right in "What's the matter with Kansas?"  (How to get voters to vote against their obvious interests.)
Craig is against anyone that's born with brown skin, Mike.  Read all of his comments against Alaska Natives, American Indian, blacks, Pacific Islanders etc.
Kenneth Conklin: Your constant attack on EVERYTHING HAWAIIAN, has reached an all new low! Here, you have managed to denigrate & greatly offend a whole race of people! To suggest that Hawaiians have a better chance to be "cleansed" on the Continent is extremely offensive & racists.  If your AMERICA is so great, why not go back there? America the land of mass murders, lynchings, brutal slavery & rapes of slaves, bombings of Black Churches, where it's open season on Black's by Cops, & a country on the verge of a race war.  Yet, you hide in passive Hawaii, where it's safe for you to continue to spew your hate against everything Hawaiian. You know full well that the majority of our prisoners are Hawaiian. Maybe your family is toxic to you. For you to project your own familial deficiencies upon Hawaiians, is not only insensitive, but pathetic.  You don't like Hawaiians go back home!
Alright. There are some nuances, but most mass shooters are still white males. There were a couple black mass shooters, and one women, but the thought that this one justifies a war against neatly 1/4 the worlds population is completely off track. Most mass shooters had some major failures in their lives and or psychological problems before they went on a rampage--this guy falls into that profile regardless of the reasoning he proposed. He wasn't affiliated with terrorists. He had known psychological problems, was on an FBI list and was allowed to buy a semi-auto rifle that isn't suitable for anything other than killing people.
The US doesn't have a race problem its called a race system.  And its just as insidious in the democratic party where you have a president who admits to using archaic racial hypodescent  thinking so he could be Black instead of "passing as black".  A vice president who confirmed this by using old school terms like "clean looking" to describe him (meaning superior intelligent mulatto like white folks).  Yes America has a RACE SYSTEM where over 30% of white people are actually mixed race not including Natv, Blacks  and other groups who are mixed white and do not identify as white (because of antique cave dwelling hypodescent beliefs of subordination of races as the child indentifier).  Making white people the most mixed in this country.  Is trump calling for blood supremacy?  But other groups do who a, and their race system depends on it. You folks think Trump has a problem?  LOL!  He is just raking the dirt a bit and exposing your own comfort in the race system.  The comfortable racist.
The saw about politics applies to all of it: the process of making a bill, like that of a sausage, ain't pretty.  Politics is a blood-sport. Everyone gets splashed, mangled, transformed. But a democratic republic is the best system ever devised. Imagine if liberals/progressives had refused to vote until the perfect (whatever that could mean) candidate came along. We'd be a country to the right of Putin's Russia by now. Any observer of American history must see that progress always has come slowly---------- but it HAS come. I align myself with those who feel that a society should be judged by how it treats its least powerful citizens. African-Americans, during my lifetime, have vastly improved their lives, overall, but a long struggle remains. I cannot imagine a Latina or a Muslim smiling at Ms. Porter right now. Her lackadaisical approach to their real issues must be frightening. A Trump presidency greatly would disturb or ruin their lives.
The dichotomy you describe with respect to discrimination isn't so much 'progressive' inconsistency as it is 'conservative' hypocrisy.  White supremacist social, political, legal, economic and educational policies and practices are still very much with us.  I can understand were, not really having been on the receiving end of same, that you may not have noticed.  In a 2003 University of Chicago study of over a thousand entry-level employers in New York, Chicago, Milwaukee and Los Angeles preferentially hired white applicants who claimed felony convictions over well-qualified black applicants with no criminal records.  So how does 'color not matter' when a white FELON has a better chance at a job than a law-abiding black citizen?  Saying color SHOULDN'T matter is not the same as saying it doesn't.
This won't be an election,it will be a race census,disguised as an election..The USA's 55 million Latino's,and 45 million Blacks,will cast 98% of their votes for Hillary..The USA's 200 million White population,will vote 65% for Donald..Of course,not everyone will vote,but any way you analyze it,Hillary Clinton is going to win,by a huge margin,of 56%,to 44%..
You claim the majority of black people killed by cops were not committing a crime when they were killed. Please post a link to that statistic. It's important to use facts when you are smearing the people who protect us.
My impoverished mother scraped to send my brother and I to Catholic schools whenever we lived near one. They were rigid, & not much room for reflection or self-expression; But the academic, ruler and yardstick discipline - and no girls - did help me learn to focus academically.   However, I've no empathy for this decision - and I might feel differently if the sexual misbehavior of so many priests hadn't put the Church in the position of the child-molesting pot calling the homosexual-lesbian kettle black. The Juneau Chapel is a locals & tourists quiet spot of beauty and tranquility. If they don't want Alaskans or visitors of other faiths or of non-heterosexual preferences to use the Catholic Chapel itself for ceremonies - I can understand that - to a degree..  But the grounds could certainly accommodate a roofed/open deck for others to engage in positive spiritual sharing on occasion. The Bishop's stance would be quietly clear, yet the Shrine still be spiritually welcoming place to all.
Mark and Nigel are terrified of having a black man occupy seat four. They try to come off like liberal progressives who care about diversity, but the reality is racial diversity in the political process in Portland Oregon is what terrifies them most. WW is the inbred second cousin of the National Inquirer and its struggles to stay afloat, having to downsize the actual newspaper, for financial reasons is part of the slow, painful demise of this irrelevant newspaper that no one really cares about anymore.
This is ridiculous and obvious that some on this site have no idea or concept about what the constitution says? I offer each of them a copy since it is obvious they have not read it! Dangerous criminals what a laugh, they harmed no one unlike the FBI who actually murdered an American Citizen! The other concern I have is the fact people will allow their rights so willingly to be taken away, until they have none. Meanwhile BLAck Lifes Matter, burn towns, block federal highways, etc but no consequences! Some people have really screwed up values apparently! I stand for Freedom!
so out of all of this death, you're unhappy about what a killer is called?  How about the fact that people of color will always be labeled 'terrorists' and white murderers are referred to as 'gunman' or killer.    Just curious Jimmy
Black Lives Matter!, wait then what about Red, White, Yellow, and Brown Lives? If blacks can say nigger in the white house then what the hell you doing taking my comments down? Get a pair nigga!
And if you're going to go the 'statistically speaking' side of the argument, you should know that statistically, people tend to commit crimes against people that are demographically similar to them. So while yes, since Portland is a majority white city, it lends to the fact that it is more safe for white folks living in majority white neighborhoods, but people of color have their own statistics as far as the likelihood a crime will be committed against them. I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color. Using a majority white, relatively crime free population stat to silence the experiences of brown people is a pretty standard way of keeping people of color on the fringes of the reality you and Tyler Hurst live.   Long and short of it, statistically speaking, you were bound to try and deny our experiences as people of color.
I don’t disagree with your science; but your dictionary definition and even the one in Black’s Law Dictionary are merely the summation of my argument. A ‘person’ is what ‘society’ says it is. There are no ‘legal rights and duties’ except in relation to a society. The legal ‘rights and duties’ of many ‘persons’ in this country have changed significantly in just the 227 years of its existence or even in the last five to ten.  The Bible, for example, defines the rights and duties between a master and his slaves. (It’s in the paragraph right after the 10 Commandments. Exodus 21-2 thru 21-20.) Without slaves in a society their ‘personhood’ is a non-issue. That section also sets forth what penalty there is for striking a pregnant woman and causing her to miscarry, so this issue of death in the womb has been a societal issue for millennia.
Please, no premature evaluations! This is a tragedy. We do not yet know who did it or why. We have theories and concerns, but they are not fact.   I do not believe this has anything to do with the unjustified shootings of black citizens. While that is a tragedy in this country, this seems unrelated and an opportunity to wrongly take the focus from the current reality. We will all know more in the coming days.  But for now: Black Lives Still Matter.  And I am sure that no one would disagree that the lives of innocent public servants, who have not participated in the illegal killings of anyone, also matter.
Dat knee grrr was a thug. I normally use N word right bout here. Blacks support anything without knowing about it first.
When our pathetic racist president Obama said police acted stupidly in the D.C. case he declared open season on police across America. He is to blame for the racial divide in America today.  And in other news , blacks continued to slaughter other blacks last weekend in Chicago. Where is the protest over that ?  Black lives clearly don't matter if blacks are the ones doing the killing.
Former Rep. Joe Walsh Tweet this after the police were killed (Godspeed)   "3 Dallas Cops killed. 7 wounded. This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you."  The is/was an elected official of the state of Illinois  This.  THIS right here is why this Republic is in serious trouble.     Link to text.  It's DemocracyNow w/Goodman and at about 17:00 in the full show (not the link above; that's a news capture.  Anyway, this former NY Detective, African American, had an emotional moment that just moved me so deeply.   He was speaking of all of the killings and videos of racist killings of black men/boys, children...and he just couldn't talk.  I think I saw he even got embarrassed cause he was fighting the tears.  It was an extremely powerful moment because he really loved being a policeman and he is struggling.  For his people.  If you want to view it here's the link: http://www.democracynow.org/  EXCELLENT and very informative segment
If black people cared about black lives. Then they would spend their time and energy getting black people to stop killing each other.
During World War II, African-American enlistment was at an all time high, with more than 1 million serving in the armed forces. However, the U.S. military was still heavily segregated. The air force and the marines had no blacks enlisted in their ranks, and the navy only accepted blacks as cooks and waiters. The army had only five African-American officers. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and their tasks in the war were largely reserved to noncombat units. Black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war.  It would take over 50 years and a presidential order before the U.S. Army reviewed their records in order to award any Medals of Honor to black soldiers. This war marked the end of segregation in the U.S. military. In 1948 President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, officially ending segregation and racial inequality in the military.
A policeman is there to keep us safe from people like the guy with the knife . and all others that would do us harm. If a criminal is killed , and I'm NOT saying this guy was a criminal , society is better off with that person gone vs a policeman who's ability to help others is ended. The criminal will never harm anyone again.  People choose their path in life .  The up side of gang shootings , is more criminals are removed from society . As long as no innocent people are hurt in the cross-fire it's a win, win situation .   In Furguson is was sad that one group of people sided with the thug despite all the evidence showing he was charging the policeman.  Do you have a problem with the Black Lives Matter group that they protest anyone who say's all lives matter ?  People have the potential to do good or bad , but they usually make that choice by around 18 years old.   Thanks for asking.
So I'm surprised that no one has picked up on the comment about the "legalized bribery" claim...if true, are the unions not also participating in "legalized bribery" when they contribute to the campaigns of their choice?  Appears to be the kettle calling the pot black!
Finicum was perhaps all the things he's been called, but did he have some legit gripes with the feds? And sure, you don't try to escape from the cops, but if you do attempt to, should you deserve to die? Finicum did not attempt to run over a police officer, he drove off the road to avoid hitting vehicles, and the officer in question is seen strangely running into the path of the pickup.   This shooting is not vastly different from the shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina in April of last year, who was shoot running away from a police officer. In that shooting the officer was arrested and charged with murder. Justice needs to be consistent, whether the victim is white, black, sane, or a bit crazy. Justice is not served when the cops investigate the cops.
This article does not mention his race, but the nbc news article described him as a 6 foot tall black male. Sadly, it also describes him as a homeless runaway 17 year old. One young woman with so much promise, and one young man with nothing. Heartbreaking.
DC,  Because those are just statements of opinion, not facts.  There is no evidence of cause and effect provided.  The one (expelled) to three (stayed) ratio provided is actually evidence that the opposite may (notice the word may) be true.  Instead of the mythical apartheid racist state that many folks strain to prove with scant real evidence, we have evidence of white citizens defending black citizen's rights to live in Oregon when it is clearly against the law and the law not being enforced by said racist government!  No tar and feathering, no running out on a rail, no lynchings (though I think I do vaguely remember reading about the possibility of a mock lynching).  It seems to me "Oregon racism" is far more smoke being blown than fire.  But if it makes one feel good to feel guilty about policies and events that one had nothing to do with or believes and ended almost a hundred years ago, go ahead and feel good.  Just don't expect everyone else to get all worked-up about it.
Hi Frederick! Very briefly I imagined two giant dark chocolate brownies beating up on this woman. I quickly got back on track though. I'm going to be a picky snob & tell you that you misspelled Obviously as Obliviously.   I do think your choice of the use of the word hate for "animal....." is a bit unnecessary to use here. I don't really think you have this in your heart. I may be wrong, but I like to think you don't really "hate" anyone.   I finally admitted that I was a rabbit hoarder. I didn't neglect them although I lost some due to inattention. I neglected myself and society by pouring a bunch of money that would've been better spent on humans or a vacation to Africa. I did find homes for my rabbits & euthanized them when it was called for. It's been 6 years since I had my rabbit rescue. I have 8 rabbits left. Three of them are with me. Three of them are feral & I will put them to sleep. One is very old. I miss them all. Now do you hate me? Go to my FB & check out my rabbits!
Long before whitey showed up us Injuns held sporting events, and every one of us had mascots. They are our traditions and culture. Consider the arrogance of an all white state school board with 1 token black, banning the Indian mascots created by Indians for Indians on our sovereign Indian nations. This is a despicable political attack on our heritage and culture that is teaching our children a racist stereotyping of Indians. For example, us Injuns wear paint on our face for every occasion, and some wear it 24/7, and yet in racists stereotyping of Indians PC liberals claim this is "war paint." No, our mascots are not a pretty easy way to forget our culture, and history, they're upholding it.
Maybe young black males should get jobs.  Bonus - maybe the illegal Mexicans would return home.
Yes the police officer seems to run toward the truck at first....this sort of reaction sometimes happens when someone panics when a several ton vehicle is coming at them. When you threaten with a b.s. "we're armed and there'll be no violence so long as we get to do whatever white privilege destruction of Pauite artifacts we want, as long as we can ignore (see the New Yorker) the facts that in private hands land use the feds provide would cost likely three times as much, that the original owners were the Paiute, not a bunch of white-privilege, white-power would-be soldiers.....and by running a roadblock endangering police officers, and you don't get down on the ground......you get killed.     I am sorry he died.....but suicidal martyr-complex and arrogant blustering fact-ignoring narcissist is my reading. And how many of you who want to give the Paiute land back to a few white ranchers have protested the killing of unarmed blacks? Or the killing of thousands by Koch brother pollution?
This report should have never been distributed to anyone, the first thing Lamb does is show that up to 40% of the data can be inaccurate.  This entire analysis was compiled with the intent to show a bias. Stating that more force is used on a smaller population of jail residents can read exactly the opposite "Inmates of color are far more disruptive, uncooperative, violent and cause a disproportionate amount of injuries in jails".   She rounds up the summary data on page 1. It does not match the actual data on page 7 - further advancing bias.  The analysis also does not specify how many uses of force per incident in relation to race - and does not show the race of the officer versus the race of the inmate.  Truly, Lamb should have been laid off for reckless bias if nothing else.
Estimating (generously) 10,000 homicides by gun per year in the U.S. since 9/11/01, that adds up to less than 150,000 total. And no indication if the perps were Christian, Muslim, white, black, or anything else, nor is it known if the victims all were "Americans." So when it comes to 500,000, Peggy basically is just making stuff up because she's not very intelligent.
In your link, he merely says he would like to have a black wife rather than white, chinese, or whatever.  He said what he believed, a necessary ingredient of a great man.  If you had lived through the 60's and 70's while he was at his prime, you would understand just how important and impressive he was.  The world is smaller for his absence.
Ike had no "moral authority" to protect the students from the mobs and Arkansas State government threatening to kill them?  No "moral authority" to protect black citizens anywhere in the Civil Rights era from the mobs, local law enforcement, and bigots with military personnel and weapons?  National guards have been used to maim and kill striking workers in almost every state in the union where all were smeared with the brand of communism.  The Declaration of Independence is "not" the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.  The intent of all of these people and groups is to destroy the laws under our Constitution to be replaced by those with enough arms to take it all away from other people.  They are all just traitors, and in too many cases mentally deranged.
It's amazing what eye witnesses testify to.   A trial lawyer went point by point on a murder case.   He proved beyond any doubt - not just reasonable doubt that eye witness testimony is totally unreliable.  So much so, a person can swear up and down something is black ..., and the facts and science proves its: white.     I still remember hearing an officer testify about an important point.  In the closing argument it was established 100% the other way.... He wasn't lying.  He was just 100% wrong in his observations.  He testified what he wanted the case to be; reconciling in his own mind to make the world correct for .... Him.
We see a lot of anti Trump stories but nothing about the Mexicans burning the American flag and waving Mexican flags at the Trump event in San Jose.  Also what about the San Jose Mayor telling the police to stand down so they let that woman get beat up by a bunch of anti Trump people in San Jose?  And where was Obama on this?  Nowhere to be found.  If this had been whites beating up a black person Obama would have been right on top of it.  I think Trump is what is needed in America today.  The minorities think they can get by with anything.
It's "Mr."  Poverty fell during the 1990s because the economy was good, probably due to technology and the Internet bubble. When the economy went back down in the early 2000s, poverty increased and welfare was not there for people who had exceeded its five year limit. The welfare "reform" bill was an attack on poor people, a drastic cut in the safety net they depend on.  The crime bill greatly increased incarceration in this country and was devastating to blacks. They were not happy about it. Last I heard we led the world in the incarceration rate -- or maybe we're second behind China. You can look it up. The "war on drugs" was especially destructive. Putting huge number of people in jail does not solve social problems, is very expensive, and the country is now backing away from it.  Al Gore, like the Clintons, was a conservative southern Democrat, and a hawk. By the end of Clinton's term a lot of us were sick of all that, and still are. No sale.
Catherine endorses  the notion of controlling individual behavior that is perceived as disrespectful.  Once that endorsement is made, once it is accepted that individuals must tow the politically correct line, we cannot fault a group for their PC decisions.  If those at the college find sombreros objectionable, who is Catherine or anyone else to object.  The principle of forcing individuals to conform to PC notions as in "black face" is established.  I think most Americans, if asked privately whether wearing black make-up was unacceptable would say no.  The media on the other hand has decided that black make-up is a social no-no.  Not because it is physically offensive but because they feel, what, that whites have no right to enjoy emulating those with natural black pigment?  What the media proclaims often has little to do with what many Americans think.  That is why Trump is popular.  We are tired of the media controlling us.
I love your victim blaming. The fault is clearly the officer's, or his training.  On a stop involving a missing taillight, the first mistake was going up to the car with gun out.  And what don't you get about Black Lives Matter?  It means exactly "all lives matter."  I love the poor attempt to spin it into a anti-racial attempt, but you can't ignore racism in this country, and you can't have "All Lives Matter" without having "Black Lives Matter" too.
That pretty much precludes every ethnic group in the world from managing resources.......Mayan, Aztec, Spanish and those of Spanish descent, English, French, Africans, Semitics, Asians, many Native American Tribes.....Yeah, that pretty much does it. Every culture has blood and warfare on their cultural "hands". None are wholly innocent.
Equating Bernie to Chavez, VZ to DK: being kind in saying, "exaggeration." Germany big enough? Remember, it's got contingent of former lazy ol' commies, too. Very successful doing just what Bernie says.  Helping works, not just for Europeans. And Germany has had a large influx of Turkish/ Portuguese too. As far as ethics: Americans work FAR longer hours, for less wages, less benefits, less time off. This is true of the working class, especially. Your charge that Americans are less "disciplined" than others is bogus. Remember now, our leadership began during the 50s. We had a large African-American and Latino population then, too. I might remind you that our economy still is the wonder of the world. It is wealth disparity that's the problem: "wage stagnation" and a tax system that overly benefits the wealthy and the very wealthy. Thanks to Reaganomics, our investment in education has shrunk. I think you're the one who'd be happier in another country, a 3rd world one with very low taxes.
It take someone from the far right to see that black on black violence is epidemic.  It does however take someone from the far left to ignore it.    1. If you support the 2nd Amendment what do you think it was intended for?  2. What is an "assault style" weapon?  99% of gun deaths (non-suicide) are caused by non-assault style weapons.  So all this focus on one type of firearm that causes the least amount of deaths while ignoring the causes of the violence is why this is pointless.  curtail? what so no one can own an AR 15?
We spend billions to "protect" our public in places like airports; this serves the fears old white guys have that they are being threatened as the holders of power. They need to distribute protection to include what minority populations fear and which is real: Angry, old white guys are what we need to worry about because they are very angry at women (for not staying where put, for having opinions of our own, and for voting for who we choose); what we need is more education on civil society in high school and zero tolerance for bullies; Two main bullies come to mind: George Bush and his cronies and now we have them to thank for ISIS. Now, people everywhere need to disassociate from Donald Trump and all the other haters whether it is from personal religious beliefs, racism, sexism and economic disadvantaged people. While the republicans talk about security they mean white guy's security; when they speak of economic stability they are speaking about their own.
That "genius" was a white guy in the US government who forced Alaska's Natives to give up their nomadic way of life in that region. He shouldn't be too hard to track down. Are you working on that?
Talk about a racist article. Why do you have to state that she is the first racial minority to hold the position? What does it matter at all what her race is? Why do we have to be told she is a minority? We are all equal right? What point are you trying to get across? One of the first things you want to point out is that she is African American and a minority. What does this have in any way to do with her being elected and the job shes tasked with? If a White person was elected would you make the point that it was the 5th or 6th White person to hold the position? It matters not what race as long as she does her job. Why not point out what race Dick Tranni is and if he is a minority?
"She was hired two years ago by then-Superintendent Hertica Martin, who is also black. Martin resigned after employee surveys found she was widely viewed as a poor administrator." Can't help but wonder who the other candidates were.....
While an interstesting yarn, Neal, at the end of the day, basic population trends and demographics make it almost entirely prohibitive of any R, and especially Trump winning a national election.  Allow me a second to expound on this thought: if one were to take just the West coast and the NE Seaboard, and handful of swing states (Ohio, MI, ILL, WIS and PA) these states would represent almost 2/3 of the electoral college. So, what's the common theme of all these states, are all thoroughly democratic. This not even putting into play states like Florida or Georgia. The fact that remains, is that the Ds have over a dozen ways to win the White House, and converse is that the Rs have to basically sweep all swing states or take CA or NY-- never going to happen.  Drilling down even further, unless Trump can carry the Hispanic and Black vote with approximately 37-38 percent of their vote (as a point of reference, Mitt only obtained in the low 20s); he is currently in the single digits. No way..
Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.  The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.  What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.  I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.  Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.  I don't "love" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.  My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.  But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy. Lets hope he does a lot of time.
Ms. Slovic- did you see this? http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/portland/costserving.html  It's about our cuddly hypocrite, Mr. Jules Bailey.
If the majority always wins and bans YOU from doing what you believe causes no harm to others, why do even bother to vote.  I will say those who support 'majority' rules concern me.   I'm no populist, and in many cases I would not  agree with the popular opinion.   I like a representative government that has a full time responsibility to examine US law.  It's not perfect but neither is havong a huge group on no-nothings squalling for oppression of a minority.    As a conservative in Eugene, you should know this.  If only elections mattered then we might still have black citizens with second class civil rights.   (they couldn't vote in the South, how would they win an election?)  The LAW protects our minorities from unjust treatment.      Stop and consider that ALL of us have had a minority opinion at one time or another.    There are very good, very personal reasons, for ALL of us to worry about not protecting the rights of a minority.
No more niqqers nips spics or Jews
When women wanted the right to vote, millions of women stood up and got it done. When African Americans wanted civil rights, millions of African Americans stood up and got it done. When the LGBT community wanted the right to marry whoever they wanted, millions of LGBT members stood up and got it. Now millions of Americans are tired of the political system we have and are standing up and millions more will join in. Even if Bernie doesn't get the nom. He has started something that won't go away. Change will and can happen when millions of people stand up and speak out! We are not here just for laws passed, we are here to change the face of American Politics. Lastly Bernie is the only non-millionaire or billionaire running for President.
Wavemaker.....from the video, the two officers definitely didn't have the suspect in any sort of detainment, they were still fighting him when they realized that he was going for a gun. Didn't you watch the video before you made your comment?? And everyone here understand that if this were two black officers shooting a black criminal, it won't even made the headlines.......
As a former colonial subject (actually doubly colonial -- Indian origin, grew up in East Africa), I'm intrigued by this restaurant and will gladly visit it the next time I am in town. It's clear to me that Ms. Krantz wishes to celebrate the food and not the politics of colonial power. If one feels the strong need to protest this restaurant, such energy might be better directed towards solving local problems of exploitation and bigotry (African Americans, Muslims...) in our own backyard.  Honestly, I have more of an issue with "Tex-Mex" than I do with "Saffron Colonial." It's a sign of white privilege that hipsters have the leisure time to boycott/protest/sit on their bums and rant about this/"organize" for their small cause.
The dog and cat eating "myth" was common in the 80's. Over time, we tend to remember the outline of what we had "heard" but few facts. As with most of these things, there is usually a grain of truth that gets emphasized. 1982 N.Y. Times: "...there has been growing resentment among some lower-income whites, as well as blacks and Hispanics, who feel that the refugees are taking jobs and housing that would otherwise go to them; and after some refugees admitted to news reporters that they often ate dogs and cats in their native lands, they are blamed whenever a nonrefugee family's pet disappears."  I asked a friend who had managed housing with Asian immigrants. Many had never seen a range top or oven. He said a few tried to make a fire on the top of them. I am sure they only tried it a few times. In a land of diverse lifestyles, what is "our culture"?  Isn't it at least the effort to accept other cultural norms: Atheist, Christian, Jew, liberal, conservative, green, consumer, media, etc.?
The actual statistics from a UC Berkley study done last year shows that in 2012, welfare recipients broke down as follows: Racial groups receiving all means tested benefits: African American  -  41.6% Hispanic  -  36%  Asian/Pacific Islander  -  18% White  -  13% Your statistics are, as you put it, dead wrong. The study also found that from 2012 to 2015, there was very little change to the numbers cited above.
you have misled the city council by telling them that you are a mass transit expert when you only own a two bus system in Waikiki.  pot calling the kettle black.  just because you don't like rail does not mean that it is not good for those who want it.  you antis are just selfish.  you antis with you personal dislike of rail has caused the cost of rail to rise over a billion dollars for no good reason and you folks have no regrets.  you all should be ashamed of yourselves imposing needless burden on people.  no class, no shame.
Well, I think groups like Black Lives Matter are picking the wrong martyrs but many police surely get into that field because they like "shooting stuff" and driving too fast. Same deal with professional soldiers and other adrenaline junkies.
Do you realize over 200 million American gun owners last night hurt no one with their guns ?  No gun law is going to stop nut jobs from getting guns .  How on earth do you think it will ?  Then , what if someone passed 20 background checks and passed every one of them with flying colors  . Does that mean with 100 percent certainty that something might never happen in their life where they go crazy ?  This is what democrats do after every tragedy--they offer a knee jerk reaction that will do nothing to stop these mass murders . look no farther than Chicago with it's nation leading strict gun laws . Every single week blacks slaughter other blacks , year in , year out---by the hundreds  .  Why doesn't Obama , Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , Black Lives Matters or the national media care about those shootings and deaths given all the innocent people killed in the crossfire ?  And , how would even more gun control stop them ?  Then there's the kid who took his mom's guns . No law stopped that
Well, we have a situation here where an African American woman has complained about mistreatment by a Latino male superior.  I guess it is just too politically incorrect to terminate either of them.   So the best solution clearly is to fire the white guy.    I'm not sure how Iparraguirre and Simmons will be able to continue to work effectively together, though, under these circumstances.   Perhaps Simmons will be the next one to get the axe.
Perhaps it's time to address the black privilege in the NBA and the NFL?
Hi DC,  Regarding this quote:  “Oregon’s long flirtation with exclusion laws had finally ended. But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced, the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.” p. 171  What evidence does Nokes present that "... the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.”  Opinion is fine but opinion as fact is disingenuous.  I think the Mims Memorial is a great idea and a great addition to Eugene.  If Eugene was smart, the city would develop a self guided walking tour that is sort of like a scavenger hunt where the strollers/walkers move from site to site.  My wife and I have seen and done these in other cities, Asheville, NC has a particularly fun and interesting one.  If you are ever for it, walk the solar system in Eugene.  Make sure you touch each and every planet, to include the sun.
You're wasting your time posting statistical research, Gegonos.  Bigots like Black and Craigers don't care about facts.  The only fact that they seem to know is that they hate anyone with brown skin, that are homeless, or live in rural Alaska.
Born black or white or- but homosexuality and all of the other letters are a choice, and learned behavior. If not, prove it with DNA. All the laws in the world can not force us to call good, evil and evil, good. You cannot force acknowledgement, acceptance, approval. The king still has no clothes.
"Wendell Pierce, the black actor and star of the show 'the wire' , a fervent Hillary Clinton supporter, was arrested over the weekend, after he got upset with a woman he was talking to declared her support for Bernie Sanders. He then pushed the woman's boyfriend, and then grabbed her by the hair and repeatedly struck her in the head."....
Those cattle are pretty smart.  They have managed t0 survive, propagate and prosper without the help of the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  There are several invasive species in Alaska--the Sitka Black Tail Deer in SE Alaska, Afognak  and Kodiak Islands , the Roosevelt elk on Etolin Island etc.  Are they going to be threatened by the USFG? Surely out of the 2600 islands in Alaska one can be left to the cows to graze on the wild grass that has been fertilized for the past century.
That's a fair point, Patrick.  You are absolutely right that it's not up to me to judge whether you or any other person of color should be offended.  I'm also not someone who thinks people of color have it "good" here (I have heard the opposite) and I'm definitely not someone who thinks white Oregonians are not racist. This state was founded as a racist utopia and continues to be very, very racist.  If that's the vibe I was giving you, I am sorry, because that's not what I intended. Being a person of color is hard everywhere in America and Portland is not only not an exception to that but probably worse than many places.  I know Tyler and I felt like he wasn't coming from a bad place in his post. I felt like he was explaining a situation where he learned a *good* lesson about race.  But if you and Carlos felt like he was belittling people of color I shouldn't be trying to argue otherwise. If you do want to explain how specific parts made you feel I'll read that and process it.
1,2,3,4,5 - here comes Ernie Black to tell us how wrong this is all is....  Humor aside, I have to hand it to CW as he has energised the spirit of Alaska in the ADN with great writing and unique takes on what's happening in the land I love.
Next on the agenda after certain people finish cleaning history of all mention of those terrible white people. What to do with the people of color who owned so many Native American slaves and the thousands of black slave owners. Which black slave owners should we start with? Has anyone checked on how many prominent people of color have slave owning relatives in their family trees. It's a great comfort knowing that people of color whose history is thousands of years longer than all those evil white people are untarnished by some relative in distant history owning slaves.
Trump is an equal opportunity bigot, racist, sexist pig, he even makes fun of the handicapped, but the likes of Sarah Palin, with a handicapped child, and Ben Carson a black man still show support and look the other way, Both sell outs! what a sad America we have become! So sad!
Mr. Black, I read about southern white people who would say virtually the same thing as you during the civil rights era.  They would say that Black people in the south were perfectly happy being treated barely better than slaves and who were the civil rights workers to come down there and rile them up with ideas that they were equal with whites and entitled to vote and an education and things like that? So Natives in Canada, (and here in Alaska too???) should just learn to accept their station in society and be happy and not get depressed about it?  Common argument from the dominant group in any society.  The ones who lack compassion anyway.
I believe Morgan and Williams. I can't believe this kind of stuff still goes on. You're helping every minority who follows; women, people of color, however-one-identifies-gender-wise and so on. Stay strong.
I think my black friends in my senior age group can rummage through their basements and find one for you to copy and hand out to business's who want to discriminate against a specific class of people.
Trump will be lucky to get over 150 electoral votes.  Look at seeing Georgia and Arizona blue for the first time in ages...and Texas will be in play.  84% disapproval with Hispanics close to that with the Black community will not win you elections. There are not enough white men in this country to elect Trump.  Start saying it now...Madame President
72% of black children are born to single mom households, and liberals think the confederate flag is the problem.
By the way as it relates to the most qualified Black (Female) candidates running for the same seat as Fred, **Leah Dumas is getting my vote.**
A call for tolerance??? I disagree, we should be angry over this attack. Tolerance and turning the other cheek doesn't work when the other team is counting on you doing just that. Radical Islam does not play by our rules.   Instead of a vigil everyone should be on the phones, email and letter writting campaigns to Washington to stop this nonsense on American soil. They know who the top ISIS players are and my question is why are they still walking around free while we are holding funerals.  I think we've been tolerate enough as a country and are playing the price. Gay or not, Christan or not, white or black, it doesn't matter, they were Americans. It's time our giver many took action instead of making excuses.
Umm, where in this article does it say that the suspect was black?
Jefferson despite being a Democrat, deplored slavery. He bought as many slaves (to save them from abusive men) as he could. He wrote in his will that upon his death all of his slaves were to be give their freedom as he could no longer protect them.  Did you know America's first slave owner was a black man? Did you know Nigeria is STILL in the business of selling people into slavery?
So Hillary's appeal is to Democrats who make over $200,000 and old hippie men and women.  The young, the idealistic, those who make less money, those who think a Presidential candidate should be honest instead of electable, the Independents; Bernie gets them.   Let's see how the blacks and Hispanics go.  If she can't carry them in South Carolina and Nevada, she needs to concentrate on the Clinton Foundation.
I think a lot of racism is caused by these people being supported by the white working people of this country. We have 40% of blacks and hispanics on welfare and only about 10% of whites. I am sure the story line in Roots happened to many black slaves, but most slave owners treated their slaves quite well. How much work would you get out of people if you beat them all the time? Many in the black community have used the programs the government has given to them and they have done well.  My family was from the North and we lost some of them in the battles to keep a free country together. Do we get any compensation from the Southern Democrat slave owners? The Republicans wanted the black slaves in the paid workforce spending money because that is how capitalism works. Now the Democrats want to protect the Muslims who are the biggest slave owners in the world. They try not to call it slavery, but they use the word indentured servant. I have seen it first hand.
National Geographic, February, 1943, "Alaskan Highway, an Engineering Epic".  Describes the role of Black engineers and how the project eventually became integrated.  Initially, there were Black and White engineer battalions, but the Blacks accomplished so much more than their White counterparts that the decision was made to integrate the effort.  Everyone thinks that the Tuskegee Airman was the impetus to desegregate the military, but the construction of the Alaska Highway was the real event.
I am so glad this is over, but I can't help thinking of how differently this would have unfolded if the occupiers were African American men with guns, or Muslim men with guns or anarchists with piercings and guns....  The white male privilege combined with their careful use of words to frame what they were doing as patriotic, let them have sympathy from the press and determined patience from the FBI.  Thank goodness their fantasies about being able to leave without being arrested were not allowed to come true.  This is a country of laws and the laws should be applied equally to all.

I am a Delta fan but have had to fly Alaska Airlines a couple of times as I traveled to the Mayo for medical care. As a passenger with a disability I appreciated the excellent care and customer service I received from the moment I checked in, until the moment I collected my luggage at my destination.  Their staff assisted me at check in by reading forms to me because I couldn't see well enough to do it myself. The wheelchair was waiting for me and the young man who pushed it was funny and caring. The flight attendants helped me find the right seat and made me comfortable. They gave me water right away so I could take my medicine and when I fell asleep, one of them covered me with a blanket.  The stellar customer service was much appreciated by this passenger who was quite stressed over the thought of flying alone after invasive surgery that left me temporarily almost blind.

Christian Wihtol-    Here's some advice on good journalism- If you cannot locate the whereabouts of an individual, why make assumptions on where they live? If you do not know where they are, you do not know where they are. It angers me to see an article that spends a good portion talking about/naming someone that you don't even know if he's relevant! You bring him in to talk about his disabilities and dance around the idea that this is his fault because he is disabled. First off, you don't  have confirmation of where he lives, yet you basically blame him. Second,  you make this common assumption that those with disabilites cannot function properly and therefore can't act normal. You don't directly say it, but why else would it be talked about so many times? Could you imagine what this artical would say if he wasn't disabled?  I don't know Zach and I don't even live in Eugene. But I read this article and it disturbs me, especially after your  comment. You owe the Childers an apology.
Note to Liberals: Stop harassing a disabled woman who asked Trudeau a question that you didn't like.   http://www.torontosun.com/2017/01/15/woman-who-blasted-trudeau-gets-online-threats   "Kathy Katula, the 54-year-old mother of four and grandma of three, said after she was featured in the Toronto Sun about her Peterborough townhall appearance with Trudeau on Friday, trolls and haters have been flooding her Facebook wall with negative comments.  There were so many, she called 911 Sunday morning, fearing strangers would show up to her Buckhorn, Ont., home, 30 kilometres north of Peterborough."
Lynn,  Do you know the problems of housed people?  Do you know that housed people work hard, some times two or three jobs, to be housed and to feed their families, pay their taxes?  Do you know that housed people have children, parents, spouses, and close friends who have severe physical and mental health issues that these housed people work to care for?  Do you know that these housed people want a community where they feel safe, can use the parks, not be harassed by panhandlers and loiterers?    I do agree that the unhoused who are mentally ill or unemployed but want to work, need help.  The rest need to have the welcome mat removed from our town.
It should be noted that the basis for this G&M editorial is non-existent, as in, the source for the claims of institutional tampering has publicly said that their words were misinterpreted and taken out of context to product a claim they didn't make. It should also be noted that doping is normal in the Olympics, and Western athletes typically dope "legally" by claiming to have asthma, ADHD, muscle pain, etc. And, whether they have those conditions or not doesn't matter to the subject of doping, because as soon as dopamine is being increased in their brains by their medications, their brain and body has better performance, development, regeneration, and control, and they are doing what is called doping. Generally, professional sports = doping. 42 of 61 Norwegian Olympians since 1992 used asthma medication while competing, and so won while doping. That's 70% of Norwegian Olympians who were / are dopers. Compare that to 70% of Russia's Rio Olympics team that tested CLEAN of any doping.
There is no situation that's ok for a man to hit a woman. Are you saying that if you forgive someone you're admitting that the abuse was ok? Not even close. I was raised not to live with hate in your heart so always forgive but never forget.
love the word "sloth" - i'm not catholic....  and if i'm not doing my own digging pers se - it is because I am working -  from about 5;30a to about 8-8:30p  - taking breaks to water plants, walk dogs , check my website and take care of biz there and check in here - I love the "conversation", sharing of info and ideas,  that does happen sometimes. unless or until the p=ssing contests start .  so, anyway,  that was my day  yesterday.   ;) today's "big show" starts in about 25 minutes.  yee HA!     I do wonder at the "free time" of most of us commenters and think we must be all retired or disabled.
Well this is really baffling, 2 men being flirtatious and possibly an off-color fashion are  kicked off of a plane. While  a candidate for the presidency of United States,  can grab women inappropriately and nobody even blink an eye. An incredible blind taste sexual abuse and harassment. Oh well
Pardon me Ms. Porter but---- that's bull hockey.  Health care. New overtime rules for long-abused workers (two weeks ago!). Obama's Ready to Work Initiative. The president also saved GM and the hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs that represents. I'm sure you're aware that the large spending initiatives he proposed were "dead on arrival" because of Republican avowed gridlock and inaction? People like you scare me. You fall into the careful (but quite transparent) trap Republicans set, blaming the president and the Democratic Party because they couldn't enact worker policies, protections, and job bills.  I was a strong Bern for Pres supporter, but let's not forget Hillary and all she's done for the past thirty years for women's rights. Do you recall she's the courageous American that brought health care to the front burner, taking the heat from Republicans during her husband's presidency? She's not as left as I'd like, of course, but the enemy of the good is the perfect.
Remember yesterday when the protesters were claiming they were "Fighting Fascism" were dressed all in black and smashing windows and assaulting random people and police?   This protest is a step up from that for sure!!  Although it's confusing. If Hillary had won and become President then Bill Clinton would be in the White House who many accuse of being a sexual predator in his younger years. Hillary also went after the women who accused him of sexual assault in the 90's.   yet I bet these same women out protesting Trump today would turn a blind eye to Bill's accusations and this march would NOT be happening if Hillary had won.
I think what really alarms most Americans is the fact that the media circus substitute for real political dialogue, which they've all been somewhat complicit in for years, is now about to hand them the carnival barker for president; with all the fire-breathing, bible thumping, knuckle-dragging, anti-science circus freaks marshalled solidly at his back.  A breath of fresh air indeed---I can smell the popcorn and the elephant dung from here!  What should alarm them even more is the almost complete lack of substance toward any real policy issues from either camp.  Instead we've got the ever-dimming possibility of the first woman president, who just happens to be a Wall St. front, with the interests of the very wealthy close at heart---And her opponent who IS one of those very wealthy.  The irony is that HE'S the populist!  Enjoy the show America---The popcorn, and the elephant dung!
Bull. Some of us made sure we went to school to make sure we got into a CAREER, not just a job, that had health insurance as part of our compensation.  I did it while I and my spouse worked full time jobs, raised our kids, and went to night school in ensure I could get into a field where that was part of the compensation package.  Anyone who really wants to work at it can.  It's just easier for most people now to expect it handed to them.  There are those who have real disabilities but there was already program for that. They are not the majority with their hands out crying "no fair".
Interesting that so many Americans have no idea that it was Bill Clinton as president who drastically cut welfare benefits in 1996 and left no recipient or potential one out. Clinton's "Welfare to Work" program left a public benefit system that mostly assists seniors financially who have a low Social Security income, people who are disabled and has allowed big corporations like Walmart and McDonalds to offer low wages that place their workers personal work income under the federal guidelines and allows those low income workers to get food stamps, housing, medicaide and financial assistance depending on income and family size.  I do not think that anyone in 1996 who made a "good" law that allows a person to work a low wage job  (better than not working) and still get some government benefits had a clue that big corporations would allow the government to pay their employees out of public money. For those who think that people on public benefits are living it up, get your facts straight.
Hibler, your hypothetical is a little weird given that my wife wouldn't know what "equipment" another user of the bathroom would have unless she opened the stall and inspected that individual's genitalia. Do members of your family do that? Mine don't either.   What is a common practice is for dads to take their young daughters into the men's room, moms to take their young sons into the ladies room, caretakers taking disabled individuals of the opposite sex into the 'wrong' restroom, etc. And I have been to plenty of events where the lines for the ladies room were long and the guys were totally fine with women using the empty stalls in the men's room.   Is that going to be illegal now, too?
I understand that the Unity Center aims to serve a much-needed purpose in the community, but it concerns me that there won't be any medical care onsite. How will Unity provide triage for those with psychological AND physical health problems? Also, I wonder what plans are in place to mitigate the risk of violence and injury (remember Pacific Gateway?). If this is the only mental health facility in this geographic area, and something goes wrong, where will people go? With all of the eggs in one basket, you might create something too big to fail.
" You are lying through your teeth;"  Saying that, without any proof, reminds me of what Jesus  noted about those who are blind, but say they see. John 9:41.
Totally in agreement with you, Dennism. 25 years of wonderful work by ICEL thrown in the trash can by Benedict and a non English speaking South American Cardinal to produce the new English translation. Ill thought out, rushed, riddled with mistakes (dew drops coming from heaven), appalling theology (Jesus died for many, not all), torturous language and all done for very barely disguised political reasons. The very definition of a Benedict 'whim'.
Fascism is the politics of identity.  What you are ( Aryan, white, black, Muslim, christian etc) is more important that who you are  ( a good person, smart, charitable).   Thought control, newspeak and censorship. are how fascists enforce their own identity on others.
Victor, Thanks for this 'column'!  Of course there is only one problem with this report. It is too short.  There is so much more 'going on out there'.  But nothing going on in Hawaii other than the "Grapes of Wrath" responses we hear about on the news.   As Edmund Burke said, "When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle."  [In Hawai'i's case, the bad men are those whose covetousness blinds them to the unfairness of zoning and the need for regulating the housing market.
Truth does not change, but our ability of comprehend it does change.  That is why it has taken several thousand years for us to arrive at our current understanding.  It is human hubris to think we can comprehend all that God has to tell us.  We must be open to change as new discoveries, new understandings of human nature and of the physical universe, come to light.  Life evolved and continues to evolve.  Understanding builds - one discovery leads to another - God made us that way.  We now know that Adam and Eve had mothers and fathers, their children married the children of other human beings, the sun does not circle the earth, and so much more that was once not realized.  Be open and trust that God is always with us.
That much is painfully obvious if you are completely blind to all of the comments from the left about any minority that is a proud conservative since at least the 60's. if you are not aware of what democrats think and say about any minority who is conservative, especially anyone who is black, man or woman, then there is nothing I can do or say that will bring you into reality.
Here’s a running list of the Republican leaders who said they will no longer support Trump in November:  1.) Utah Gov. Gary Herbert : "Donald Trump's statements are beyond offensive and despicable."  2.) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz: "I can't look my 15-year-old daughter in the eye and tell her I endorse this man for president,"  3.) Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock: "This is disgusting, vile, and disqualifying," she told the Washington Post,adding that Trump "should step aside and allow our party to replace him with Mike Pence."  4.) Idaho Sen. Mike Crarpo: "Donald Trump should step aside and allow our party to replace him."  5. ) New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte: "I'm a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women."  6. ) South Dakota Sen. John Thune: "Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately."  7.) South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard: "Enough is enough."
A few weeks ago whilst in south Anchorage Sams' Club location, in the front area where food court & exit are located, was a commotion; some woman appeared to have fallen on the floor.  As I walked toward the front of the store, she had started gagging, coughing, & convulsing. There were about 4 to 6 people around her, so it was hard to tell if anyone was trying to perform CPR or some other emergency assistance.   By the time I approached nearer, several employees were close enough to see the woman needed help. None of the employees appeared able, or interested helping. About then, I got to the front of the store (not far from the exit) a man was able to help the woman get an obstruction from her throat by performing some (abdominal thrusts) vaguely like the Heimlich Maneuver.  http://www.wikihow.com/Perform-the-Heimlich-Maneuver  So apparently that business does not train employees in this kind of matter. I'd think Sam's Club should've thanked him at least... Cheaper than a law suit.
It’s not the act, it’s the cover-up….  As good as the chief may be, this one decision is damning enough for me to think that he should consider resigning. Food for thought: he could have killed or paralyzed his friend.
Their a lot of people who are very angry of the injustice that maybe coming from Trumps cabinet picks. He will try to distract the people by outrageous tweets and by the games he plays, but people are starting to stand up more then ever. We have much too lose. For example, how the world view the US. If we pull out of the Paris Accord we are telling the world that our treaty's to other countries means nothing to us anymore. Same thing goes with NATO and other countries we Militarily support. For example S Korea would be invaded by N Korea and that could destabilize the world economy. I think this time things will different then other President's because if Trump goes along with those around him, he will be making the following very angry - Blacks, Muslims, Native American, LGBT community, Public school teachers, women, immigrants, the elderly, the disable, middle class, poor and I sure I missed a few groups. But you get the point.
Such disrespect for the transabled. Surely their time will come?  "Gender dysphoria" is as much as socio-political term as it is a medical one. The term is used in preference to "gender identity disorder". DSM-5 introduces the term "gender incongruence" as a better identifying and less stigmatising term. The cause of this condition is as yet unknown: it is psychological or psychiatric in origin and not physiological.   Are you so cavalier about the mutilation of genitalia as you are that of breasts? Perhaps you agree FGM should be permitted if a child or young woman wants it for religious/cultural reasons?
Earlier you wrote, "True leaders step up to the podium and own the problem(s) and take responsibility. Period.  That's what the governor did with his PFD veto.   Your aimless rambling on about the LNG project (seems those checks and balances didn't deliver the answer that the administration wanted to hear). shows you have no idea of what checks and balances mean. Back to civics class for you.
I'm not going to touch 'that one'.  I shall say that science and religion are at odds with each other.  Gould used the expression NOMA;  no overlapping magisterium.  When I see prayers, as in the article, it seems like trying to fudge a puzzle piece where it does not belong.  What I would appreciate is positive proof of the power of prayer.  Otherwise why pray at all.  As said, we live in a dog eat dog world, big fish eats the little fish...do we give thanks to that.  We have disease, physical affliction, disasters many fold, and the god of the Jewish Bible is a cruel, vindictive, angry assassin.  All church negativity is based on the errant Original Sin.  Now that we know it is bogus, how do we account for all the human suffering.  It is not as Mother Theresa says or the church has said;  suffer now your reward is in the world to come.  That does not suffice or account for the pain and suffering...thanks we give, but ignore not the want of relieve.
Let's see... you're creating an association simply based on being the presidential candidate alone. However, the two could not be further apart in regard to presidential qualities. On one hand, you have an individual who has belittled and mocked the physically disabled, bragged of sexual assault, settled a $25million lawsuit (guilty!) for FRAUD, called for a ban on specific immigrants based on religious beliefs, made countless derogatory remarks towards women, was guilty of racial discrimination from housing practices, seeks to fill his cabinet with the very swamp he proposed to drain, makes baseless claims regarding security and voter fraud, has been caught in countless lies, and lost the popular vote by one of the largest margins in our nation's history.   On the other hand, you had an individual who had a FLAWLESS record, came from nothing by way of hard work, instilled hope in millions of Americans (yeah yeah), and sought to work across the isle for the greater good. So, uh... nope
'Ignorance' Stolberg shows the mentality that is oppressing societies ability to educate close minded, opinioated and heartless, self involved people like I. Stolberg. I'm sure if your loved one had this disease or you gave birth to either one of those gentleman, you possibly would take time to educate yourself before making intentionally rude and ruthless ignorant opinions. At least use some class. Two men ultimately lost their lives and the people who love them shouldn't have to be assaulted with your idiocy!!!
Should we contact ghouls and goblins too see if their being discriminated against too? It's a fun holiday taken with a grain of salt. I can't recall anyone coming out of a haunted house saying "i look at mental illness differently now"  Should we contact hollywood? I fear people will be discouraged by blind people because of the recent scary movie "don't breathe" *sarcasm*  There's a difference between a portraying yourself as a murderous lunatic on a holiday as opposed to legitimately discrediting a mental health program or person(s) as dangerous without reason nor warrant.
My, my, my  --  who'd'a thought it?  We've come to the attention of ANOTHER group of issue zealots.    Google Don Scott and motorcycle noise  --  he's a Californian who's commenting everywhere.  Ditto Rickey Holtsclaw,
Problem is white people don't know what to think.  They vote for a two term black president - that's pretty color blind and a good thing.  But then they see the footage of the Milwaukee riots.  Here's a situation where a black cop kills a black man.  Appears to be justified, not 100% sure yet.  Response from that community?  Burning, looting, torching vehicles including police cars.  Young thugs by the dozens burning down their own community black businesses.  Hard for whites to understand and even harder for blacks to defend.
Two excellent books that can help us greatly to be healthier mentally and physically - Healing the Gerson Way by Charlotte Gerson at www.gersonmedia.com and The Green Body Cleanse by Dr. Edward Group at http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/the-green-body-cleanse.html.  Nutrient Power by William Walsh PhD is an excellent book for those who want specific help with mental issues such as depression, anxiety, bipolar, attention deficit disorder, Parkinsons disease, or schizophrenia.
This is the process in Winnipeg if your elderly mother is dying at a catholic hospital today and requests assisted dying.   The palliative care team is not even allowed to approach and assess her for this procedure. It is essentially an unspoken act. The family has to pursue transfer to another hospital in the region for discussion despite the fact that she has been admitted to her current ward for weeks. Beds may not be readily available for transfer. So you wait, hopefully not too many days. Only when a bed is available do they bundle up your frail mother and transfer her across the city on a bumpy ride in -30 degrees to a new hospital where no one knows her. You get readmitted and have to meet an entirely new health care team. Only then can discussions on MAD take place.   This is merciful? As a Catholic physician caring for some of the sickest patients, I'm appalled.   Yes we move people around for angiograms and what not, but treating the dying the same is inhumane.
Interesting solution you propose. So you would facilitate the lifestyle of these homeless?  In other words you propose to reward obnoxious behavior.  Then Anchorage becomes even more of a Mecca for the homeless.  Unless an individual has physical or mental disabilities that prevent working for income, I have no pity for the sloven homeless that infest our city.  All the things you propose could be had by people willing to work.
SNAP solves a very real and very immediate problem -- that of feeding people who cannot buy food with their own resources.  These are real people, from infants to very old, working people, disabled people, those disadvantaged by societal expectations they can't meet, et., etc., etc.  I spent the first month of food bank (SNAP and local charity funded) volunteer service in shock, meeting clients and helping them obtain VERY LITTLE food that needed to last them a month.    Familiarity along with empathy really do help achieve genuine "charity" -- the virtue you preach about interminably.
AT:  May I honor and congratulation you on your success.  Obviously, you've worked hard and achieved a very successful life.  I, for one, don't suggest that every white person has an easy road.....we know that's not the case.  I don't suggest that minority individuals are so disadvantaged that they can't succeed in America,.....we know that's not the case.  I do feel that Blacks in America are still disadvantaged...they still play on an unlevel field.  It's better than sixty years ago, and much better than a hundred years ago, but it's still unlevel.  Racism is still "alive and well" in America.  As I often post, take a look at the millions of hateful, racist posts targeting the Obamas.    You use the term "empower".....a great way to empower is to fight the institutional and personal discrimination which still exists in our community.  Recognizing it still exists and fighting it is not "enabling".  We all need to work together toward a truly "color blind" society....... long way to go
This is disappointing that Time magazine has honored this narcissistic misogynistic human who all through his campaign picked on minorities  even going as far as mocking disabled people.  I want Time Magazine to explain to my daughter who is 27 and sufferers from Autism that this is not a honorable human and not someone who deserves this cover ...I will never buy  or read Time again
Hmm. So what options are available for those suffering from chronic, severe pain?  Just live with it?  As time rocks on, that seems to be the favored alternative.  Chosen especially by those not experiencing chronic, debilitating pain.  Human compassion at it's finest.
I did not say I was homeless, panhandling or living on the street.  I have been homeless in the past.  Also, nowhere in my statement did I say I want someone else to pay.  That's a lot of assumptions, which I often find people making when they speak of the homeless.  Yes, I know *some* people aren't willing to work, but some are just down on their luck and are fighting to find a way back.  Lately, I find myself worrying quite often about becoming homeless, so I can't help but sympathize.  My landlord may be getting foreclosed on, and I have been searching for a new place to live.  I do what work I can, but with my injury, full-time has been proven to not be an option for me.  Instead of sucking up from the government, I opted to start a small business, and that's where the computer becomes necessary.  It's my livelihood.   And no, I can't move where I want to with my dogs.  Landlord policy has seen to that throughout most of Anchorage, not to mention that rent is outrageous.
I remember years ago, and we're talking 1960s here, there were 4 men who went bear hunting near the Wrangell Mtns. They shot a grizzly and took some meat back to camp, cooked it up and divided it among themselves. One man said, "I'm sorry guys, I just don't feel like eating this." He'd watched the bear ambling around, minding it's own bear-ly business, seen it shot, helped skin and clean it.  So the others ate his portion, too, and no more was said. Within one year that man saw all 3 of his friends develop cancer and soon pass on as a result.  He  died from old age many years later. No cancer. I'm just sayin', is all.
Now the Old Men's Club are threatening to Exorcise, Ostracise, and Subjugate, the union conferences that have voted to ordain women (or alternatively, to cease ordaining men).  It won't work.  As Monte rightly points-out, the voting majority in the conferences, opposing the GC actions, will grow stronger.  The harder the GC policy mavens push, the harder the voting constituencies will push-back.  Witness the most recent voted response of the NAD Executive Committee.  The ultimate recourse of the Old Men's Club would be to deprive these local constituencies of their votes, by trying to force them into "mission" status.  Even if this dubious maneuver came to fruition (which is not at all obvious), it would be a Pyrrhic Victory (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory).  Presumably the Old Men's Club will not persist until like blind Samson they pray "let me die with my enemies", and pull-down the house on top of themselves?  Fortunately for all concerned, this is God's Church, not ours.
You are in my prayers and I suggest you see a therapist.
I tend to agree if he had killed the man he would be in jail himself right now; and here's the irony because the homeowner confronted the man the man can sue the homeowner for shooting him especially if it causes what's considered "permanent damage" to his leg and he's unable to perform the way he did before.  Simply because he tried to stop someone fleeing from troopers/police.  I believe in helping where it seems smart and safe but that was neither smart nor safe; the man pushed you to get past you because you were blocking his way; so you shot him when he tried to charge past next; likely the homeowner will end up with charges of some sort and sued if the criminal has even a half decent lawyer... Sad but true
Before Donald Trump and/or any of his supporters start making excuses that if he loses the election it will be the result of a world wide conspiracy, please consider the following; he has alienated himself from so many groups, Blacks, Hispanics, women, people with disabilities (who did I miss?), oh yes, POW's and Muslims...he said that he wasn't going prep for the first debate and suffers the consequences. Possibly, just possibly, if Donald Trump loses the election it will be because fewer people people voted for him than any other candidate and he will have no one to blame but himself.
Dear Snowflake-in-Chief, please be advised that your feelings and beliefs, however precious and adorably child like they may be, are not "facts."  I know it's scary to live in a world where you are not universally loved and adored, but you picked this role for yourself and now America needs you to learn how to stand up on your draft-dodging flat-footed hind legs and wave your tiny front paws in a credible imitation of a human being for four years or at least until the Articles of Impeachment attain bipartisan support.  Good luck.
Why would someone leaving a driveway be cause for endangering life or inflicting serious physical injury? There has been no reason given that the individual was dangerous to the public if not "arrested without delay".    Keep in mind that AS11.81.371(a) requires that the officer "reasonably believes" the individual may endanger life or inflict serious physical injury.  No evidence has been given that the officer(s) had any belief that the individual was an immediate danger to the public.  If in fact the officer(s) had "reasonable belief" he might endanger life or inflict serious physical injury, the basis for that reasonable belief should be made public.    If the officers are claiming self defense (most likely) the basis for the use of lethal force in self defense should be public.
We paid a lot of money to plant them in Juneau once again and that is where they can stay until they end the session. Who would support paying to load the legislative circus train and move it?   As of today here is the only metric they provide that indicates legislative productivity (from bill statistics on the Legislative web page) Number of Bills Introduced by both House and Senate: 588, Number of Bills passed both House and Senate: 51. They won't report the fate of the 537 bills that are lingering somewhere in their system; however,  they apparently have plenty to do and I suggest their location has nothing to do with their  incredible ability to not resolve the people's business (or perhaps to introduce worthless legislation).
Joesf Stalin: A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.   Sure, Fidel lovers, what's a few tens of thousands murdered, hundreds of thousands exiled and how many homosexuals interred in re-education facilities?  You who lick his boots, each of you, are apologists for evil.   From Amnesty International:   "Over more than five decades documenting the state of human rights in Cuba, Amnesty International has recorded a relentless campaign against those who dare to speak out against the Cuban government’s policies and practices."   and "Repression takes new forms in today’s Cuba, including the wide use of short-term arrests and ongoing harassment of people who dare to publish their opinions, defending human rights, or challenging the arbitrary arrest of a relative."  None so blind as those who will not see.
He must have missed the leg he was aim'n at...
Recent tie to autism and momma doing antidepressants
The public record disputes your "facts" just like everything else you write in your blind fealty to all things Republican, Conservative, christian fundamentalist.
Karen, that is because you didn't read all my comments.  Except for infirmity, any MP/MLA/MPP who steps down mid term should leave without a pension.
"Many of these people have skills and the they will learn the language just as others have in the past." It seems most do not have skills appropriate to our economy, and learning a language enough to be functional as adults is difficult and takes time. Women like the one described here, with five children, two disabled, and no language skills,  most likely won't.   "I say this same type of crap when the boat refuges from Vietnam came over and they could speak French." Most were in fact well educated and they spoke French, a western language with the same alphabet as English, that made learning English a lot easier than someone who only speaks Arabic or some other Middle Eastern language.   " I suspect it's not what they speak or don't speak that bothers you, I suspect that they are different and that upsets you."  Of course you would, that is your way of dismissing all criticism.  Those Norwegians would no doubt be skilled and educated and speak English, big difference.
Non sequitur?  Not in the least.  You asserted a criterion ("attacking virtually every Christian value…”) for excluding a presidential candidate from the Al Smith Dinner.  My question stands on its own; it does not relate to Clinton.   Donald Trump is a vulgar boor who has built his presidential campaign on xenophobia, racism, misogyny and nativism.  He ridicules  women, mocks the disabled and attacks racial, ethnic and religious minorities.  He's pretty much the textbook definition of a fascist.  He’s a serial adulterer and accused rapist and molester.  The question is: Using your criterion, does he get invited to the dinner?   Not for nothing, but: Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country that Trump ever has or ever will.
I have never taken Genesis as anything but allegory. I don't know where you got that idea about the literal reading. You misattribute that to me. It doesn't fit, it is offensive. Even if it were correct many things that might be correct are not necessarily civil, such as the above article title, which is definitely not civil, and NCR is supposed to set the tone for civility. The accuracy of a statement does not guarantee that it is civil, et vice versa. A man with a disfigurement we don't call "scarface",  we don't call short scrawny men "runts", or people in wheelchairs "cripples", or people without mental abilities "reta*ds". I don't agree with the author that the church has a "slimy underbelly" when it comes to women. It is an offensive expression, and people have been censored on NCR for less offensive expressions. I don't see how they can censor anyone now after letting this offensive title stand.
Wrong Mr. Herz when you wrote: "The fight over the Southeast sales dates back to 2005. "  Your story about potential logging on 2 tracts in the midst of the 17 MILLION acre Tongass National Forest starts back prior to Alaska Statehood  --  almost 60 years ago.  The Feds granted the right to select 1 million acres throughout Alaska to a trust to provide for the mental health needs of those living in the Territory of Alaska.  Fast forward through actions and missed opportunities of several levels of State, Federal, and local governments, politicians, and agencies; with environmental activists and jurists to further confuse and frustrate the situation; and you'll start to see the full and real setting of this story.  Bottom line.  The Trustees of the Mental Health Authority are not as implied by the story and the commentary "bad people"; they are acting properly as trustees of an Alaskan Authority with clear cut "beneficiaries" and purpose.
Candidate Trump conveniently cannot remember the name of the Doctor who diagnosed him with a bone spur in his heel so bad it would exclude him from the draft.   I wonder how many other "special" deferrals that same "unremembered"doctor granted for "favors" from the wealthy and more fortunate like Trump`s father.  Throughout history many conscriptions took place in most major societies..but it was always possible to pay a "tribute" to get passed over.    There were probably a few unpopular Roman Senators who were suddenly needed by Roman legions at the front, fighting the barbarians, who, being important leaders needed at home as well,  preferred to "buy" their illness and excuse for not serving.. like so many so-called political leaders who went on to involve this nation in war without having served in uniform.
You're right. But those with epilepsy cannot do stuff like the rest of us. Perhaps I could recommend a high CBD strain of medicinal cannabis oil. Or would that get your panties in a wad as well?
This task force is going against the recommendations of Health Canada on age of access. Health Canada sets 25 as the age limit due to risk of brain development damage and other risk factors. Health Canada also acknowledges that men who want to start a family should not use marijuana due to risk of testicular cancer and sterility and we have science on dna damage - this is a travesty that will be fought as will the fact that the PM - if he accepts legalization takes Canada out of the most ratified piece of human rights legislation ever passed - The Rights of the Child.  Go look up the disclosure statements for the co-chairs of this task force and then do something to stop this run away train wreck that is headed towards a generation of Canadians. Do something - all teachers, all doctors, all parents acting can stop this.  18 years of age means kids in school could have legal access.  If we do not stop this - get ready taxpayers because this generation are going to sue for damages.
Nice dodge of the issue.  We have no writings from Jesus.  All we have are writings from unknown authors who never met or witnessed Jesus.  I would think that Jesus would not need Pasteur to explain the germ theory to Him.  According to Scripture and the reputed healings;  disease, physical afflictions and so on were caused by sinning.  The cure was an exorcism and therapy to go and sin no more.  What does any of that have to do with what I wrote. My response, better put would have been to another article.  My issue is not the personal derived benefit from individual or group prayer...feeling good about it.   The sole issue is whether there is a concrete intervention  resulting from prayer.  I know of no evidence or proof that it occurs.  Each day there are thousands dying of cancer, and  numerable maladies throughout the world,  see my other post above, all having prayers to no known avail.  Jimmy Carter's sister opted for prayer instead of medical treatment.  She died horribly.
"Spirituality, from a Catholic perspective"... with which i'm quite familiar; and, yes, i know all about "sine cera", but you didn't speak to the immediate material, physical aspect of spirituality, consciousness, etc., that are IN THE PRESENT AND, NOWHERE ELSE (?). Not? If somewhere else, except residing physically in the present, where? where? [Maybe Tridentinus has clear and precise answers. :-).]
That is a very ambiguous if not contradictory notion.  It  is clear many more people than anyone had suspected are suffering from some form of "gender dysphoria". Acknowledging that is one thing.  The bigger issue for many people is what that means in terms of the responsibility of society, particularly one that provides free health care.  Many physical conditions are not actually life-threatening or even impeding people in their daily lives, but "cause distress". Some of those we treat no questions asked, but others regarding appearance for example, are considered "frivolous" and "cosmetic surgery", and the individual must pay to "alleviate their distress". No one would seriously argue that being distressed by a big nose or wrinkles should be sufficient for treatment for those to be covered by our health system.  The argument for making gender "affirmation" surgery something insurance, public or private, pays for is that it is a medical condition.
Reminds me of the Nine Blind Hindus feeling the elephant.
What really got me POd from the first republican debate, was that Trump was said to have "won" the debates, (by all the THs), just because the other candidates were too civil to snarl back similar insults, with sneers, grimaces, and bullying remarks.  This is the guy who tweeted he would spill the beans on Cruz's wife, tweeted that Cruz's father was implicated in the murder of JFK, insulted an 18 year old foreign beauty queen by calling her Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, and so forth.  Mocked Mrs. Kahn for not speaking out at the dem convention.  Mocked McCain for getting captured as a POW, and mocked a severely disabled reporter.    The NYTimes made of list of the 281 different targets of his nearly 4,000 malicious tweets.  So, no Melania, you aren't going to get away with pretending to be some moral compass for our American children.    http://www.motherjones.com/media/2016/10/new-york-times-donald-trump-insults-twitter
Boozer:  You mention that people who really would benefit from help are not getting it.  Could you expand on this point.  I believe we should be targeting our assistance where it will really help those who are willing to help themselves.  Additionally, there is, I believe, a population of folks among the homeless who need supportive living placement.  I refer here to the mentally-ill, developmentally disabled, physically disabled, vets with PTSD , etc.    The substance addicted and chronic alcoholics do need support...usually a residential treatment program....if they're to change their lives.  Who are those who you refer to as not getting help?  What kinds of help would you propose? and how do you feel about those other sub-sets of the homeless?    I'd enjoy sitting down with you over a cup of coffee and discussing these issues.  I'd like to better understand your perspective.  Let me know if you'd be interested.  regards,  Gary
Before praying the Angelus prayer Sunday, Francis reflected on the day's Gospel reading, in which Jesus is approached by followers of John the Baptist and asked if he is the savior John had been preaching about.  Jesus replies: "Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised."—Joshua J. McElwee  This is the time for some of us to remember, “Make firm the knees that are weak” (Isaiah 35:3), particularly in the snow.  More importantly for yellow-dog Democrats, in this era of The Donald, “Lord, come and save us’ (cf. Isaiah 35:4) and have mercy on those in the Middle East and on us for whatever our responsibility may be in international affairs for what is happening there due to machinations of the United States of America.
Thank you Haley for bringing your story forward. Agencies are contracted and funded by the DOE and are told not to communicate with parents or anyone outside of their agency. There should be more protection for those who come forward with information that protects and advocates for our children, as many have no physical voice. As another reader wrote, there should also be an independent & confidential investigation process. I think you have opened the public's eyes to the fact that the DOE needs to put more support, funding and training into it's SPED program. Wish there were more people like you in this world. Mahalo!
I did that, hosted a woman from Oaxaca Mx for Mobility International.  She was a blind woman who needed a wheelchair and they presented her w/one.  It's a great organization and a wonderful time w/a woman from another country.
To me it's always been a blight on TO's landscape and now with the anti police mantra by LGBT and BLM radicals I believe Toronto should withdraw funding.
Right on, Geoff!  Thanks for the laughs.  I am sure others can add their own 'Only in Alaska' examples here.  For me, the part I immediately related to was the "...traveling to the Lower 48 is most Alaskans' worst nightmare."  The last time I flew into O'Hare from Anchorage, I got physically sick to my stomach when the taxi driver came ripping up out of the tunnel and merged with 6 lanes of traffic as we made our way to Union Station to catch the Amtrak.  I mean, dude, just -look- at all these people!!  Another was when I was out on a walk on a country road on a 15-degree day with blowing snow, enjoying the bird songs and a stiff North wind tearing across the prairie.  Multiple people in cars stopped and rolled their window down and said something along the lines of "you ok man?" or "you need a ride?"  It was then I knew, beyond any other indication, where my home truly is.
Identify "...only half of the people," ItsMe.  And don't cite the elderly, children, or the disabled that are on public assistance.  Since you have time to blog on this website, why don't you open this link and see for yourself how many people are eligible for public assistance.  Now, minus public assistance recipients, identify the other half that don't work.  Good luck:  http://dpaweb.hss.state.ak.us/files/reports/Csld&BeneSumm.pdf
You grown men gotta read what you have been writing. High Schools arguing. After all the crazy stuff and antics I've said on the radio, I'm probably not the one to chastise others for their public vitriolic clashes. But dang! Guys you sound like a bunch of old women or High Schools Girls bickering and trying to one-up each other through ignorant insults that are far from funny. It looks like Old White Guys trying to play Basketball. Please stop! You're embarrassing yourselves. I think if most of you cursor your comments, you most likely will agree.
skyofblue,  1) Their are two native reserves within the confines of Metro-Montreal.  Their shared basic common culture is not Judeo-Christian.  2) People are always identifying this so-called "basic common culture" in a generic fashion, as, once one gets into specifics, it's clear that Canadians share a pretty minor "common culture" beyond what is highlighted in our laws, governmental institutions, and national documents.  And most of these elements would receive shared support from those falling outside the so-called Judeo-Christian consensus.    "But no one ever heard of ethnically-based gangs with real violence..."  You never heard of the mafia?
The vast majority of people with mental illness do not kill three people.
Jesus did not believe "Thou shalt not steal"?  That's funny.
It's ALL on video:  The Muslim ban, the David Duke denial, the “Mexican” judge flap, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the draft dodger denigrating John McCain’s military service, the son of privilege attacking an immigrant Gold Star mother and the constant revisionism and lying about past political positions taken are but a few of the lowlights that have punctuated Donald Trump’s chaotic chase for the presidency.
You are wrong.  Again.  I gave you the information concerning his cancer...it was in the obit the NYTimes published.  His cancer was NOT undetected when he was appointed the DRVC, it was in remission. A very different thing.  It came back quickly and took his life within a year.  I still have not read or heard ANY comment upholding your claim of "uncaring comments" made to the priests of the Diocese.  Nor do you provide any context for the alleged remark, only what can be considered your rational for such s remarks...which is obviously quite untrue.  It is unfair and cruel to make such allegations with no support, even if the Bishop has been dead for 16 years.  As I said, I never heard anyone remotely suggest what you have stated.  Many people mourned him, priests and laity, and I am again unsure where you come up with your conclusion.  It's untrue.  One is left to wonder why?
They probably include teenagers not home and people with dementia or alzheimers and anyone else that doesn't show up on time somewhere and somebody calls about it.  Statewide that might make it a big number.
LOL.....only a far right deluded type would call someone a loser and reference Jesus in the same sentence and be blind to the fact.   Go show that to your Minister and ask him/her what they think?     BTW Jesus was most closely aligned to Socialism (as was Einstein) as that is the ideology that looks after the poor while recognizing that a rich man has the same chance of entering heaven as a camel passing through the eye of a needle.    Don't worry, just like politics, Jesus escapes your ken.   peace
So...you oppose universal healthcare then.  Like leave the poor and the ill and the disabled to rot while the top 1-2% live in luxury and have penthouse type hospital rooms when ailing?  And just what constitutes a "Just Society" in your view?  And how does the Gospel imperative of Love Thy Neighbor fit in for you?  Just wondering, Dromig10...
I liked the article's final sentence. There's a tendency among certain women to consider women's rights exclusive to women and among men to consider some human rights exclusive to men. That's the stage we're at for the moment. Eventually both men and women will accept the obvious that rights are human rights and gender is irrelevant where rights are concerned. That ideal might have come closer to realization under Obama, but, given Trump's attitude to gender, is likely to suffer a set back. Women did the right thing to protest against that possibility and I hope they continue as a united front of protesters when other important issues like climate change, free trade and health care are threatened by regressive policies.
I used to work with the homeless mentally ill and deficient.  I had a client whose mother was raped by her own father, gave birth at 13 and spent a year in a mental institution as a result of the trauma. Her child was schizophrenic and very malformed, and resistant to taking medications.  Another's teenaged mother had TB, tried throwing herself down stairs and drinking cleaning fluid. She died six months after giving birth to a girl who had an IQ of 56, who was raised by a uncaring stepmother, and was institutionalized at eight years old, still not toilet trained.  Had you been the one seeing that their moms did not get access to abortions, back in the '30s and '40s, I expect you would have been very proud of yourself.
You couldn't be farther from the truth. Serious and severe "mental illness" is a brain disease. It needs to be treated.  if we didn't call cancer or diabetes or migraine headaches by their names,  they would still be serious illnesses.  Even though there are no cures for these serious illnesses yet, they are all still helped by pharmaceutical interventions. Why would you deny treatment to people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder?
Earth and ecological nature are the common vehicle of all life - than which there is no other - NO TRADING IT IN. In the 'ride of life' we are in different places, but in the same vehicle - it's our government, our employment, our existence, our religion, our politics. We have many passengers accompanying us. We can't make the trip alone without the others. If we don't all do our part to maintain and update our common vehicle, together we all crash. Liturgy begins with care of earth; church liturgy is practical and meaningful through the lens of conscious 'earth-belonging' and authentic doing of 'people-work'; belonging and doing are inseparable from each other. Church is more than just human beings! 'People work', doing ecology, is now the compelling faith-sense of liturgy I have that replaces blind faith in church liturgy and self-submission to hierarchical church.
I don't believe that at all. Realize Scandal (in this sense) = Whistle Blowing and your thinking will fall into line. When Jesus said that whoever harms a child should be dropped into the ocean with a millstone around their neck, He did not further say "unless, of course, such an event would embarrass a bishop." The bishop MUST report such horrors and let the chips fall where they may. Otherwise, the bishop must be held morally and legally culpable. Your answer, unintentionally I'm sure, would justify the whole clergy abuse and cover-up scandal. Never again!
The Republican party, corporate media and enabler Democrats were never held responsible for starting a war based on lies.  We had obvious forgeries being passed off as evidence, by the corporate media who Republicans pretend is liberal.  They supported Bush's wars every step of the way, and they will do it again for Trump.  I am truly hoping that the Republicans that voted for Trump really did want to drain the swamp.    I thought that maybe there were some Christians out there that felt bad about supporting that war based on lies which resulted in the deaths of so many innocents, mothers, babies, pregnant women!  I prayed that there were Republicans that cared about the debt and the waste of Trillions of dollars.  I assumed they cared because of the way they want to cut off the poor, ill and disabled in this country.  We shall see if they have real values or are just blind followers.  God Help Us!
Well since replying to Chad seems to be a blocked effort lets try this means. I asked where Djou was going to be instead of the debate not why he was not attending. No follow-up on why he is not attending is his personal commitment donating a kidney or a fundraiser?
My point exactly.  You negate the relevance of the social issues of today (which this pope does not) in favor of some esoteric "eternals."  So my question to you is:  why can't the social issues of today be addressed with what is truly "eternal" - the teaching of Jesus Christ?  Why repeat the same mistakes over and over again, of thinking it was all answered centuries or even decades ago?  It seems to me that the attitude of 'everything is fixed' defies what God's Creation is all about....a constantly evolving and changing revelation of His Will.  I suspect, however, that you and I will continue to disagree as to the idea of keeping a dualistic view.
God performs abortions all the time. I've known many would-be mothers who were traumatized by spontaneous loss of their pregnancies. There are times when for their own reasons women do not want to continue their pregnancies and I do not think the government should force them to continue them against their will. There are fetuses in the womb which may be identified as carrying major defects which would make their lives a burden for themselves and their families. Babies should be born healthy and wanted by their mothers and their fathers. There are stupid reasons for terminating pregnancies, also (sex selection, for instance). The world and its systems are not perfect. I choose to err on the side of family choice.
"separate pedestrians and bicyclists from motorists." I can't wait to hear how the planners reconcile that with Kitty's "multi-modal" approach to transportation, where people in cars share the same space as buses, bicyclists, skateboarders, and the handicapped.
And your are not being honest, denying the reality about these kids. Ask a parent of a low functioning autistic child what they will do with their kid when they age out of the schools. See the worry in their eyes.   Or watch this        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j4PTf7LgsIE And ask your self if that young man will EVER hold a job.
Thank you tRump for leading this nation down a broken path of civility. All your hate filled speeches, mockery of women, military vets, the poor, and disabled is your mantra for the next four years. Maybe. You can't spew the hateful venhem and think you can get a positive outcome just because you're headed to the White House.
I'm afraid that they think of the laity as simply their piggy banks and volunteers to do work for them.  It really is a feudal system.  They take nothing into consideration if it goes against their rules.  All Catholics must have exactly the same mindset because if we don't, we can't really call ourselves Catholics, as we have heard so often in these forums from the blind folowers.
Trump did not mock his disability. He mocked his not remembering.  https://youtu.be/M4604reEqk0
I won't argue that homophobia and mysogeny are characteristics of some Arab Cultures.   But it's impossible to tell if that applies to immigrants.   If anything, they could certainly find a more agreeable place to stay than this country.  They are leaving violence, poverty, threat of death for a better home.  This isn't easy because of the huge differences is culture.     And just as we have  American homophobia and mysogyny despite our civil law, there are Muslim people who reject homophobia and misogyny in their own country.   War does a lot of damage, immigrants certainly come with emotional baggage that can be difficult to handle.   I don't expect 'fuzzy bunnies' as you might say.   But I do support the healing of people abused by their circumstance and running from tyranny.
That's because Nancy was a prescription drug addict most of her adult life.  Her daughter, Patti Davis, discussed this issue in her autobiography.
You need to look up the definition of dementia as I am using this word properly. I am not in the least mocking people with disabilities. I am disabled, and how dare you accuse me of making fun of the disabled because you do not have the intelligence to debate this issue.
Maybe sixty years ago, dioceses began to have annual appeals in addition to the cathedraticum.  At one time The (New York) Catholic News published the goals forced upon the parishes. Later, those lists disappeared, and one could not compare the goals, parish-by-parish, result-by-result. Then came waves of long-range expense appeals, and good pastors were expected to wring from parishioners multi-year pledges. Too many years and too many campaigns have gone by, and now the Archbishop complains that people see him as money-grubbing!  On August 1, 2015, quite a few NY parishes were classified as "No regular weekly services," but the chancery has given little or no information about maintenance costs, sales, or rentals.  I suspect that, had the churches been closed, real estate taxes might be due.  Stewardship requires the disclosure of details.
Just dig that hole deeper and deeper.   Using terms like 'not a good look' and 'tone-deaf' illustrate that you know the content is offensive, reductive, and simplistic to the point where it paints all members of a racial group as less than and uncivilized (with a reference to movies to boot), but are unwilling to call it racist, because you know the writer.  It seems that because you are from Ohio (I can search FB too!), a place more ethnically diverse in population, you are somehow more of an authority on the realities of race (and crime) and that us safe, lily-white OR residents cannot understand.  Well, (and this is not the first or last time I've been lectured by a white male about why something is not racist and I need to get over it) you are wrong, sir.
The Columbus Ohio Dispatch endorsed Clinton- first Democrat since 1916.  Read this, and ask why Murkowski and Sullivan took so long, waiting for a video.  Without Trump's lewd comments, do they think he was qualified to be President?  " He has proved himself a liar of epic proportion. He is a bigot, a braggart and an admirer of foreign thugs such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He is reckless and thin-skinned. He has demeaned Mexicans, demonized Muslims, insulted women and mocked the disabled.  His economic policies, to the extent that they can be analyzed, would at least double the national debt. His call for punishing tariffs on foreign goods would trigger retaliation and ignite a trade war with disastrous results for employment and the standard of living in the United States.  The stakes are too high to sit out this election and risk letting Trump misuse the awesome power of the presidency. The Dispatch urges voters to elect Hillary Clinton."
It is truly sad and indeed unfortunate that we have no writings from Jesus.  If prayer has 'concrete' effects, any, forget the impossible to comprehend 'infinite effects;  what are they, and show the evidence.  NONE as you claim are scientifically confirmed, though many have claimed to be.  "healings incongruent with the known course of disease, etc."  are not scientifically confirmed healings.  In fact, quite opposite;  they are a confirmation of 'ignorance'.  Throughout history the legacy has been to affirm to a god what was not known at the time.  That is the 'god of the gaps' argument.  But, 'was once not known'  at a particular time has been filled later by discovery.  Unknown causes of healing now will be known and understood in a later tomorrow.  'No known medical rationale for healing, is not a miracle, it is a statement of ignorance.
In Syria and Libya hundreds of thousands of Christians have been killed because of Clinton's actions and decisions. This for some reason is not criminal?  This lady needs an international trial for the countries she has destroyed, the democracies they have installed are everything but democratic.  The lady is not even well, physically and needs to be checked by psychologists and doctors.
Unfortunately, Fr. Pavone's tactics are gross as well as delusional.  Pro-life means respecting humans born with disabilities, physical as well as mental, about being against total warfare [which could kill millions at a time], and is against slavery.  Fr. Pavone is not against slavery.  He believes he has the right to demand, in the name of God, that women must give birth if they are impregnated---no matter under what condition that pregnancy occurs.  He doesn't realize that this is an act of slavery.    If an individual does not have control over their bodies, their very lives for almost a year [not due to incarceration in prison for a crime], this is church-enforced slavery.  Abortion and how to perform it, was included in the Midrash tradition of Judaism, even in the 1st Century in Palestine.  Jesus knew about it, and did not condemn it.
In around March, 1968 my uncle was classified 4-F due to his asthma being so bad. In October 1968, he was called back in for another medical evaluation. He was informed that his asthma was not so bad after all, reclassified 1-A and ordered to await further orders. He is still waiting. Trump's story about the draft is not surprising and not a big deal. You should read the cite by akjeff64 if you want to read a real convoluted and desperate, if not illegal, avoidance of the draft.
He got the pardon only because the Obama administration, Hollywood, and major media  promote transgenderism as normal.   However,  Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital and its current Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry, said that transgenderism is a “mental disorder” that merits treatment,  and that people who promote sexual reassignment  are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.  Dr. McHugh, these “policy makers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding, treatment and prevention.”       As for Pvt Bradley Manning who has changed his name to Chelsea Manning.  Many undercover Afghans  in Afghanistan were killed by the Taliban as a result of his an Wikileaks actions and  a lot of NATO soldiers too lacking  intelligence assets within the Taliban.
misogyny: "dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women."  homophobia: "dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people."  These definitions come not from "the PC set" but from the dictionary, available to any and all. And yes, the magisterium of the Catholic Church systematizes both.
Wow that comes from a man who does not check his grammar when accusing someone of not being intelligent. I guess we all know where you got the name.
Sorry, do people enjoying themselves trigger your insecurities? The only indecency to be found during Pride are the sad bigots who  are blind to the abuses of society toward anyone who isn't a white hetero male.
It wasn't your zygote, embryo, fetus or potential child, it was hers. That your relationship was destroyed is possibly testament to what might have proved to be your lack of fortitude as a parent. Obviously, given the threat to the health of the woman you call "a girlfriend", she made the right choice as regards her body---her property.
No autism? Guess you didn't have them all and several others all in the same day.
I paddled the length of the Grand Canyon in an inflatable kayak solo. I've also paddled solo in Antarctica. I am very comfortable doing this but refused to take a passenger with me. They throw in potential problems I have no desire to deal with and I am a licensed guide in Idaho and Utah. I'd hate to see a regular customer have the responsibility of another unskilled paddler. Was it the blind leading the blind?
Zero.  Nearly all of the "guilty except for insanity" and absolutely 100% of the "aide and assist" patients come to the psych hospital after months in county jail (not the same as prison, I know, but close enough).  You're talking about people with physiological disorders - you'd have exactly the same success rate you would sending people with cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer's to prison and telling them to "shape up."
Sarasit,  Unfortunately, in too many church bulletins there is already a Voters' Guide that lists that Donald Trump is anti-abortion and Hillary Clinton is not, therefore---he is pro-life.   Are our church leaders so blinded by Trump's manipulation about 'his truth' that they can not see the crass and demeaning underside of his campaign?  There is more to PRO-LIFE than just declaring "I'm anti-abortion."    Insults hurled at fellow candidates' spouses and parents, mocking individuals with physical disabilities, trashing the sacrifices made by individuals for our nation, belittling people because of their ethnicity or religion, making incestuous comments about his own daughter, AND treating so many women from past and present as consumable merchandise for his taking----presents both parents and teachers of children and youth with horrific issues not present at the last election of a president.   Frankly, our church leaders really aren't saying much of anything to help.
E.S.:  Your post seems to imply that ALL those pandhandlers are scammers.  Certainly, as I have repeatedly acknowledge, some of them are.  However, may I suggest that many of them use the money they get to survive another day.  The mentally ill, the developmentally disabled, the vets with PTSD, the alcoholics, the drug addicted, etc all are, to use your phrase, "people who are genuinely in need of assistance" and, yes, many of those very people are out there on the streetcorners.    Please provide me with a list w/addresses of the service providers who will immediately provide appropriate support  for these needy folks.....rehab. centers, assisted care facilities, residential treatment programs, etc. and, instead of giving them a buck, I'll give them a ride and help them register for that support.    I'd rather give a buck so someone who"didn't" need it, than refuse to help someone who did need it.  If that makes me a sucker, so be it.......regards, Gary
James Reeves - You can’t show one study that ANY food, drink, supplement or medicine is safe in any concentration for all of the public; infants, children, pregnant women, those with fluoride allergy, those with weak kidney problems, the elderly, etc.  Why then do you eat or drink any substance that contains potentially harmful chemicals??
What a line of BS - to celebrate our independence by recreating the sounds of WAR. Our independence day should be a day silence and reflection on lives lost and lands invaded.  Never forget, every firework you hear is heard by a  Veteran that suffers from PTSD .
Good friend, Vietnam vet, has used cannabis for ages to manage his PTSD. Had to give it up recently, VA would continue to provide him with any medications if he used anything illegal in their book. These guys are young, have a long life ahead of them. Need to set their sights higher. Can't raise a family and save for retirement on $12 an hour. Sincerely hope they take advantage of the GI bill and make getting a higher education their goal. Not much demand beyond guarding grows for trigger men. They may have the training, but they have so much more potential.   Carry on.
I believe  that any serious student of history or current events should come to the same conclusion of George Washington that party politics are an abomination.    From his Farewell Address:  “However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”   His only blind spot is that he failed to predict that by 2016 there would also be "cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled "  women involved as well.
Okay. I watched the video too. I empathized with Strickland for a moment too. He obviously has loads of mental health issues and no doubt those issues were being exasperated by the crowd via whatever verbal and or physical threats that began before the filming began. (Side note: I don't go to these rallies even though I support the causes because the masked anarchists with their raw physicality and verbal prowess scare me almost more than the evil-doing being done that we're protesting about). As someone else said up above there somewhere in the comments, toward the end of the video some white folks do try to get verbally aggressive with the camera man, and a couple of other black folk do appear to be physically posturing towards Strickland. These things made me uncomfortable on behalf of Strickland. I wanted everyone to leave him the eff alone, for their sake and his. BUT YOU DONT BRING THAT MUCH AMMO WITHOUT PREMEDITATION! End of story. Everyone--Strickland included--got lucky.
OK folks, here are some possible solutions: Do  away with the tax cap and raise taxes; do away with the senior property tax deduction; do away with the disabled veteran property tax deduction; do away with the homestead property tax deduction; start a 5% city sales tax; and start a school head tax. That is all I can think of but I am sure the Assembly and mayor can come up with more "creative" solutions as long as we don't have to cut the city budget and personnel.
Senior clergy have NO concept of protecting children because they have NO direct connection with children in the role as true parent.  They have no concept of the scope of responsibility a parent lives with and how intimately connected is that responsibility to the physical, mental, emotional safety of the child.  With the ridiculous vow of mandated celibacy they have "squozen" (to quote my grandson) the humanity from these men as it pertains to the most basic link we forge in life -- the next generation.  (Apologies to those priests who post here, but I believe this is true.)
As to your last paragraph, which gets to the meat of reality, dominion theology/ culture, and speaks to the theological justification that exploits nature and people with abandon (on literal belief of the Garden of Eden Story) and yet justifies the waste of nature and people that foments real hurt and hysteria in our time. In context of the exploitation of people, the real hurt yet falls most heavily on women; "knighthood" and media play into their exploitation, in the present as in the past. My daughter teaches a College course what i call 'Humanities', and for it she has written her own textbook titled: "Women and Men, and How Media Attempt to Define Us". Excuse me, but, if i may, the crises issues at hand go way beyond your myopic dislike for Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, SJ. You shutter yourself from real-world consciousness by closing your mind to him and fixating it in a dream theology of your conviction. Know that i mean no personal offense! Shine! shine on, Oh Bethlehem Star!
Oh my Susan is having a Trump derangement seizure because her gender was cheated out of the Presidency by all those right wing American women voting for Donald Trump - except of course in California where Governor Moonbeam runs for it for the open borders and sanctuary crowds by the sea.
It is unsettling that Trump has anointed his campaign manager, Steve “Turn on the Hate” Bannon, to be his chief White House strategist and senior counselor. Bannon led Briebart News, a vehemently anti-Obama propaganda outlet that has pushed white-supremacist policy positions, as well as conspiracy theories, and racist, sexist and anti-Semitic opinions. What Bannon said this in an interview published Friday was truly creepy:  “Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they (liberals) get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.”  The senior counselor for the President of the United States pushes hate and models himself on Lucifer and lies.  Can’t you can see why Luke and so many other Americans are disgusted and upset about our post-truth president?  See: http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-donald-trump-satan-darth-vader-2016-11
Hello:   I am addressing this to the people responsible for the cover of Time Magazine as of December 7th,2016.  My name is Darlin Bonchek and we live in Ontario  with my husband and 4 grown children. I was so disappointed when I saw  the cover of Time.. This man (term used lightly) because that is a title that has to be earned. For the past year he has insulted woman, war heroes, immigrants, disabled people, newspapers,  and almost every other minority group there is.  I am sure President Obama has like other presidents influenced many young people to dream about possibly being president one day.   I cannot see this person having anyone wanting to be him one day. At least I hope not. My daughter is 27 and suffers from Autism, and when she was about 5, she learned not to insult other children.The future president of the United States mocks handicapped people and time puts him on cover.  We love the magazine although we will never buy Time magazine. no Your values are not our values,
It's a sad reflection on the 47.9% of the people who voted  for a man who gave practically no details on how he will "Make America Great Again"  I ask; for whom was it great for?  White, wealthy men?   Minorities, women, people with disabilities and low income folks are still waiting for a country that is just and equal in it's treatment and opportunities.  My biggest concern is Trump is a climate denier and we are almost out of time before runaway climate change destroys our biosphere.  Get out of our way or grow up Trump; we have some work to do!
You ask an interesting question.  May I simply suggest that not all human behavior is rational; in fact, as I look around at what we do to each other and to the earth, sometimes I think we're more likely to behavior in irrational fashion.  ...and, yes, I consider supporting that a man who, all his life, has demonstrated the moral values and emotional instability of Donald Trump, to be irrational.   After the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King, inner city Blacks in LA burned their own neighborhoods and looted and destroyed businesses owned in many cases by other African Americans.  In my opinion, their"blind anger" fueled irrational behavior.  Our history, as the history of all nations, is ripe with examples of various types of irrational "mob" behavior.    IMO, the support of Donald Trump as a Presidential candidate reflects a widespread disillusion with the "status quo" in peoples' lives.  It seems based on the belief that America is "going to hell in a handbasket"  (con.)
Add to that, there is less up side in simple saving than there used to be. It used to be that if you delayed gratification/sacrificed to save for something you wanted to buy in the near-/medium-term, the interest rate on a straightforward savings account would help you get ahead (i.e. closer to your goal) and your sacrifice would be rewarded. Nowadays, you fall behind as prices escalate beyond what your savings can generate.   I don't condone over-buying, I wish more of my young friends and neighbors were more careful with debt (particularly for non-essentials), but I'm also not blind to the fact that our present circumstances have created large disincentives to saving as compared with the past.
boy, enough can't be said for safety equipment.  thank god this guy had a hat on and built in mechanical safeguards on his equipment ( can hardly bare to think of his accident...)  .  his angel is on his shoulder and maybe he should buy a lottery ticket.  speedy and full recovery to him...
I was born in 1965 and lived in the Minneapolis area, so the Mary Tyler Moore show was one of my influences as a girl that I could be a strong and independent woman.  So sad to hear of her passing.
People this is really very simple. The oil companies are trying to convince the public that fracturing the earths crust in a very active earthquake zone with extremely toxic poisons that can , and will , migrate to drinking water supplies is a " safe " activity. Obviously they do not live in the areas they intend to destroy. The crust cannot be put back together, the poisons cannot be removed from the drinking water, and the frequent earthquakes will increase in magnitude, and damage. We risk all of this to follow the illogical plan to destroy our land to profit an oil industry that is robbing us blind , both before it hits the pump, and afterward with rising prices. Apply logic and the entire fracking argument goes right out the window. We can live without the oil and gas trapped in our earths crust, but we cannot live on a totally unstable surface with poison drinking water. The value of your property is " 0 " to the oil company, and they would destroy it for the oil and gas.
It's the big IF ... lot's of proof out there, including his own finger-pointing at the Japanese for not having his vision, to indicate that this is another governmental boondoggle.  When will Alaskans learn that Government is not the private sector.
In response to the authors closing sentence.  There is also no credible evidence showing vaccines, or more pointedly the additives used in vaccines, don't cause autism or chronic illness. The reality is neither side can prove their respective cases.
It's not "religiously blind" it's one religion over and over again...you're blind if you think Islam has nothing to do with all of these "incidents"
One and a quarter percent  increase over each of 3 years for Ontario doctors.  Cutbacks on special needs school children.  Yet $ 1 billion and counting for four liberal seats  -- e-health billions wasted, Orange, MARS, and the list goes on.  This woman is tone deaf and no friend of Ontario people.  Just another grubby, grasping pol.
The human race has been given a wonderful gift. We can logically determine how reproduction occurs and if it is correct for our situation. It is an animal mentality to feel the need to reproduce no matter what.   It is true that some of the human race cannot naturally reproduce due to choice or biology. Who are dead ends with no rights? I guess I am. I have been heterosexually married for well over 10 years. But we never planned on children because it wasn't right for us, and then I experienced a form of cancer that made me sterile. So I never planned a reproductive lifestyle and am physically unable. I am a deviant. And proud.
No mistake.  Minshall  reminds me of one of Dave Chapelle's characters, Clayton Bigsby,  the blind black man (who didn't know he was black) who also happened to be a leader in the white-supremacy movement.
Or something wrong with a religion that has already sent people into a church to cut the throat of a priest while he gave mass, and therefore, the need for Catholic self defense.  But I forgot:  progressives are blind to history.
AnonAJ - you know, I have vivid memories of watching both my mother and my father showing such love of those less fortunate, be they mentally retarded or homeless or those in great poverty.  My mother, with several other LADIES (always women, it seemed) of the parish go to the homes of those with disabled children/relatives and talking with them about coming to a parish program designed just for those individuals.  I saw how my parents touched and talked with and sat with all of those afflicted persons, sometimes with their heads on my parents' shoulders or in their laps, and tell them how much God loved them and offer a treat, or sing a song.  This is why when I see Pope Francis hold the face of deformed and disabled people, and kiss their heads and bless them, it fills me with a pride (of being Catholic) and shows me the side of the Church that I love, the side that really matters.  You give me the same feeling.  This is exactly what so many can do, leaving the culture wars aside.
Seven and a half months to get fitted with a tie-dye robe a go deaf.
An excerpt from my lengthy and oft-posted alert about the 3dozen+ deadly diseases that Roy Anthony's vermin cats spread to humans:  ... Then there’s cats’ most insidious disease of all, their Toxoplasma gondii parasite that cats spread through their feces into all other animals. This is how humans get it in their dinner-meats, cats roaming around stockyards and farms (herbivores can contract this parasite in no other way). 60%+ of game-animals too. This is why cats are routinely destroyed around gestating livestock or important wildlife by shooting or drowning them. So those animals won’t suffer from the same things that can happen to the fetus of any pregnant woman. (Miscarriages, still-births, hydrocephaly, and microcephaly.) It can make you blind or even kill you at any time during your life once you’ve been infected. It becomes a permanent lifetime parasite in your mind, killing you when your immune system becomes compromised by disease or chemo and immunosuppressive therapies.
"The Department of Veterans Affairs has estimated that PTSD afflicts 11 percent of veterans of the war in Afghanistan and 20 percent of veterans of the war in Iraq."  "After a trauma or life-threatening event, it is common to have reactions such as upsetting memories of the event, increased jumpiness, or trouble sleeping," the VA says. "If these reactions do not go away or if they get worse, you may have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder."  "Veterans of the two wars, the VA notes, were often at risk for death or injury. They may have seen others hurt or killed. They may killed or wounded others themselves. "These and other factors can increase their chances of having PTSD or other mental health problems."  Eleven and 20 percent of veterans. Millions of our fellow citizens. Thanks for your gift to the people of this nation, George W. Bush. No doubt you sleep well at night, having found your joy: Collecting your pension and your whiling away your days with a paintbrush. What a patriot.
Miller held my brother as he died of a heroin overdose in September. I met her at the whitebird clinic at his memorial as well as his street family. If you compile addiction and mental illness. A sense of desperation the lack of hope and resources. No address and physical illness. What would anyone be left with. There is an underground community of really good deserving people with talent and love that cannot get help or help themselves. ..people spend more money time and energy dressing up and cleaning up after animals than on their fellow man! Breaks my heart!
95% of people agree with you (including you and I), being civil is a good thing. The problem starts when you can't say proven facts because it hurts someones feelings. It's a problem that many politicians have. For example illegal Mexicans abusing our system, that 9/11 was not a disaster it was a radical Muslim terrorist attack, or the widespread fat people epidemic in the US (to just name a few). But if being civil means ignoring real problems and only caring how it makes someone feel, I don't want to be civil.
Leech for BM?  Perhaps while she's building her wall she will mandate all women, people of colour, jews, muslims, the disabled and veterans to be removed from Canada?
Sorry, there is no such "split".  We revere Father Abraham, Ishaaq and Yaqub (alayhimus-Salaam) as holy prophets of Almighty God.  And, according to direct Commandment in al-Qur'an, we follow Jesus (alayhis-Salaam), whom Qur'an identified as al-Masih, the Messiah--the one who cured the crippled and the lepers, gave sight to the blind, raised the dead, and was born of a virgin woman; who was exalted as 'Ruh'ullah'--a Spirit of God, 'Ayatullah'--a Sign of God (by his very existence) and Kalimatullah--a Word of God.  THAT's the Jesus (alayhimus-Salaam) we follow.  I submit if you're following a different 'Jesus' from that, you're following the wrong one.
Many of the negative outcomes associated with opioid addiction are directly related to the controlled status of these drugs. Drug-seeking behavior, including lying about dependence and misrepresentation of pain levels, as well as the use of illicit alternatives such as street drugs or illegally accessed prescription alternatives, are fuelled by the ever-present threat of medical cutoff and withdrawal. As for people who've developed psychological as well as physical dependence, the idea of broaching the problem with their GPs is a non-starter unless they're ready for a permanent mark on their provincial medical record and a lifetime ban of opiates except in emergency situations.  I suspect that many people who'd like to get medical support for their predicament are frightened off the idea by what it ultimately means... that is, being officially branded as an addict. The current setup virtually guarantees that large numbers of people who could use help are too scared to ask for it.
I’m reminded of the South Park movie from 1999 where the kids are urged to “find the clitoris.”  Failure to identify a clitoris isn’t going to cause someone to get pregnant or contract a disease.
Check your history Mike, it wasn't "Chanel and Prada, etc."  in 1930s Germany.  It was Jewish shop owners in Jewish neighborhoods that had been historically segregated from a largely anti-Semitic German society.. It's more like if you and your white friends came to Nanakuli and smashed in people's windows and killed their dogs and chickens and beat their keiki up in the streets because you thought a federal government sympathetic to your views would turn a blind eye.
They always run from the facts that expose their ridiculous nonsense for what it is. They debate like cowards. It is why I refer to their liberalism as a mental illness.
Ponder as you wish, AkJen, and I wish you an honest and truthful answer, within your own belief system.  I shall ponder as well, especially within your own dream, though I am coming around unto it, especially unto the blind eye, which I shall address at a later time.  I wish you nothing but the best, AkJen, and shall never wish to deny you your own content destiny, as you so obviously deserve.
There are still many on the streets or within our community who should be getting treated that are not.  People and families know nd ignore it as nothing is wrong.  Why does it have to take drastic measures such as them (our mentally ill) if you will....possibly causing harm or worse death of an innocent person.  So many of our mentally ill are pushed under the rug till they finally snap.  Suddenly we find out thisc person has been ill for more times than not year's.  With little to no treatment.  Families left feeling like they have no where to turn.  Then shunned when shit hits the fan.  While frequent offenders get a pv and released again.  What are we really solving? Even the woman who ran through Safeway was set free to do it again and lets not forget one of our best officers was unnecessarily shot leaving his wife and daughter's behind way to early.  She didn't even fully comprehend what she did.  I know many who could use institution care over jail.  Long term care.  We r paying
Meli26, You're a bit heavy on the histrionics.  On the gay oppression. Yes, indeed, as was widespread to varying degrees around the globe then.  He backed off starting in the mid 80s and into the 90s. Speaking of the mid 80s, by then about 25,000 Americans had died of Aids, mostly gay. Ronald Regan famously turned a blind eye to the crisis. 'Crisis, what crisis.', and The Band Played On.   Prior to his gay 'enlightenment',  Castro gets a bit of reprieve in my book.  As mentioned in my original post, when you have a giant living next door ready to resort to just about any means to have their way with you, get some license to respond in kind. The Cuban gay population of the late 50s and early 60s was known to have a number of people helping the CIA( check out wiki).  Finally, I wonder if PET's  'The govt has no business in the bedroom's of the nation' statement  helped plant  that enlightenment seed in his friend. I hope so.

It's not about the GUNS ADN, it's about the lack of enforcment and this lame duck mayor.  I am more concerned about car thefts in the 300-400 range than hyped up GUN events.  Knock off the propaganda, it's woefully transparent and unmoving.
What a fantastic experience for you and Brett and thank you for sharing it with us!!  You are so fortunate, as Google is certainly one of the epicenters for the future for this technology!  What is so interesting to me about VR is that our brains cannot distinguish between 'VR worlds' and the real world, meaning that experiences like the superhero helicopter pilot do alter our behavior (rewire our brains) in the real world - it is estimated that behavior change can 'stick' for  many months.  In the case of increased empathy resulting from the avatar experience of discrimination, empathy can potentially last a lifetime.  As our whole bodies become immersed in the experience even muscles can get a 'real' workout as well.  We can only imagine how this training can be used for good in the world, for example igniting neurons to trigger movement in the paralyzed.   Unfortunately there is the dark side as well, such as 'real' trauma experiences from game warfare and violent VR environments.
You make a good point. What about the co-worker's report of Mr. Garcia waving a machete around? What about Mr. Garcia's Alzheimer's disease? Several people testified (for the prosecution) that Mr. Garcia was already in the phase of not recognizing people. What about the aggressive phase? Because NO defense was presented by the public defender, these questions and so many more have been left unanswered. Until young Cottam gets a REAL trial, with a defense, justice will not be served. Shame on the public defender's office!
<<they ... wrecked the process for sainthood in order to get their men in (Escriva) to push their agenda.>> It was a great blessing for the church that Pope John Paul II died before Marcial Maciel Degollado did. Having already praised him as "an efficacious guide for youth" before a great throng of people in St. Peter's Square, nothing but the grace of God would have stopped John Paul from beatifying and canonizing Maciel; and I think the grace of God did prevent it.
I have at least much right to speak as you have. That you think otherwise is one of the leitmotifs of a certain viewpoint prevalent in these discussions.  I have no idea of what “ultra-right” means other than it appears to involve those Catholics who adhere to the Church’s teachings and discipline.  I personally have claimed “NO authority to excommunicate, investigate .... ANYONE”, although the faithful are not only authorized but obliged to admonish.  Excommunication has along history and scriptural basis.  Exclusion from the synagogue was a real excommunication (Ezra 10:8), feared by the parents of the man born blind (John 9:21 sq.; cf. 12:42; 16:2) and foretold to the disciples (Luke 6:22). It was the remedy Christ admonished (Matthew 18:17) for those who insisted on disregarding admonishment.  St. Paul excommunicated the incestous Corinthians (1 Corinthians 5:5) and the blasphemers (1 Timothy 1:20).  It has been practiced by every Christian sect and body.
Hilary's Parkinson's disease is advancing.  This is why she refuses news conferences. This means either anti-Semite Kaine, or (more likely) Slick Willy will take over. It also means we will see more muslim influence in the USA aka Huma Abedin, et al., more New World Order -meaning worse world disorder for Americans, weaker military, open borders, bad trade deals, worsening of obammacare, & stepped up corruption.   If Trump goes down, so do America's standard of living, moral standards, transparency in govt, a further slide away from our Constitutional Republic.
you are so right...and what you say is so difficult. it may be intimidating -  my friend is very sick and i spend a fair bit of time there with her and i know of 3 houses around my friend's place that is from all appearances are dealing.  they seem to work kind of together...a lot of back and forth traffic. would i bring down the wrath of maybe 20 people living within 2 blocks of where she lives?  survival instinct says no...shameful stuff it is that way...
When did I say that I went to church? Oh that's you putting words in my mouth. Not surprising from a Hillary supporter. I guess having common sense about crooked Hillary, makes you think that I drank "the kool aid" lol. Can you explain to me how she's not in jail? Private email server, deleting 33k emails after FBI told her to hand them over, excepting a pricey gift as secretary of state, getting money donated to her foundation from foreign governments, some that will lock a woman up for adultery, if she gets raped, but you don't see any crime in what she did, but you're judging me? Good one. You have no common sense to do so!
I have lung issues, but I completely understand that not everyone has the financial resources to put in an optimal home heating system.  I'd settle for people at least only burning dry, appropriate wood.  I think FNSB is definitely within its rights to fine people if they're putting junk or green wood in their stoves.
"If Republican voters had nominated a typical candidate, a governor or former governor who had won office in a big state by straddling the center and the right, that man would be ahead of Hillary Clinton right now."  But instead the voters went for Trump, who has never run for nor held office, dodged the draft, and spent the last year insulting Mexicans, P.O.W.s, women, the disabled, Muslims, you name it, while saying George W. Bush lied us into war with Iraq and implying Ted Cruz’s dad had a hand in the Kennedy assassination. Then there was the part where he bragged about his genitals before ranting that he would order soldiers to commit war crimes. He cast the troops in Iraq as thieves, invited Kim Jong Un to Washington.  "This is not a good man. This is not a stable man. It is in the self-interest of no rational person to have him near the situation room."   http://freebeacon.com/columns/self-immolation-republican-party/
I guess I am one of the lucky ones, as bees, wasps, and hornets all leave me alone, even if they are in direct contact with me.  I have only been stung twice in mine own life of more than half a century, once when I was very young, by a bee, but only because it landed upon the peanut butter and honey sandwich that I was eating, and so was stung on my tongue (that hurt!), and a yellow jacket sting unto the crown of mine own head, when not paying attention, head butted a yellow jacket nest.  Other than that, no stings, and mosquitos stay the heck away from me, as I never get bitten by them, ever.  Perhaps it is mine own blood type, perhaps mine own consternation, perhaps mine own chemical makeup.  I wish I could bottle it, so that it could save millions of individuals from the effects of malaria, the Zika virus, yellow fever, the West Nile virus, etc. etc.  Of course, the monetary value is no small thing, either, to be honest.  That said, spiders of all stripes, love to hang out with me.

The death of a woman, or endangering her future fertility is acceptable to you, however.  Women bear the entire physical and financial responsibility for tragic pregnancies.  Men just sit around and judge something that they will never physically experience.  Women don't care what you think.
Ignorant and divisive always depends on individual liberty and justice for for the mentally disabled at the Attorney General's and Alaska State Trooper Offices, part of that Alaska Human Rights Law.  "It is also the policy of the state to encourage and enable physically and mentally disabled persons to participate fully in the social and economic life of the state and to engage in remunerative employment."        -- Alaska Human Rights Law, AS 18.80.200.  "Practices by the State and it's Political Subdivisions"  It's a great accomplishment to get the Federal EEOC, to do the job of the retarded state employees at the AHRC for great "Places of Public Accommodation" for the mentally retarded remunerative employment commission.  http://humanrights.alaska.gov
You are myopic.  The world has banned many cultures from hunting whales.  On the world level it is hypocritical to allow Alaskan Natives to hunt whales and at the same time not allow other cultures to do the same.  A stop to Alaskan Native whale hunting is long overdue.
Micah Johnson, who is seen on video killing a cop, joined Facebook groups that referenced the Black Panther Party, the LA Times reported, including one called the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, named after one of the Black Panthers’ founders. Johnson liked pages relating to Elijah Mohammed, the Nation of Islam’s deceased founder. This is a militant black Muslim group. Johnson also liked the Black Riders Liberation Party, which describes itself as a “new generation” of Black Panthers. This is the face of the future inbred terrorists in America.  Here he is killing a cop ‘execution style’:  http://freedomoutpost.com/police-killings-in-dallas-were-carried-out-by-homegrown-terrorist-group-allied-with-muslim-groups/
There will come a time when the PFD will go away. That is inevitable as the rise and fall of the tide, the setting sun, or colder temperatures in the coming months. I hate to say it because it has been a tremendous help to my elderly mother and disabled brother and myself.   But equitable concessions must be made before the PFD should be reduced( oil credits, union wages, you name it - everything!). And though progress has been made, that hasn't quite yet happened. So I egg on the Kearon's and the Macleod's keeping the pressure on to keep level of spending reduced to more sustainable levels.
EBhead Blind and deaf liberal fan, see no evil eh.
"Popes come, popes go; the curia remains." Perhaps no one better understands the structure of the Roman bureaucracy than TR. He seriously studied it like no other.  Inside the Vatican, is preeminent among his investigative studies.  But, alas, at heart, he himself is a greenhouse cleric. No bigger vision than reforming the curia!? Removing it altogether is not on his clerical horizon.   "Nor will filling the Vatican with progressives solve the problem..." Progressive clerics?  "In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king." Progressives, conservatives all make only cosmetic changes.  Francis attempts to make the RCC user friendly but remains rigid in "reading the signs of the times."  If Jesus could upend Judaism by rejecting the law of proportionality, an eye for an eye...and making man absolute over the sabbath, etc the RCC resists the signs of the times for fear of relativism not revolution. No score on sex abuse?  No women to humanize the moribund COC?
Old, white, male, impotent, finished.
Part 5, and the last: "...If Hillary had Trump’s biography, she wouldn’t be a candidate, and no one else would either, that Trump is still a candidate in spite of his history is hypocrisy and misogyny on steroids and anyone who can’t see the duplicity and double standard being applied to Hillary, is either lying, ideologically blind, mentally impaired, or is under the influence of misogynistic cultural assumptions, buried deep in their psyche. That people assume because Trump is rich and boisterous that he is also wise and capable of leading in spite of a history of business practices bordering criminality, is a serious indictment of American education."  Thank you, Mr. Hayes, for your excellent analysis.
Comas, severe pain, paralyzed, and incontinent, are not your, "Oh the drama".  They are quite real and near death, it's extreme. Shame on...oh, forget it. When it comes to disrespect, especially women, "nobody does it better" than you Don.
Given the city's problems, does Safeway's policy seem sane and responsible? Shouldn't pharmacies be enthusiastically willing to do anything and everything, however seemingly inconsequential, to the keep prescription drugs they sell out of the hands of even *one* kid?   I'm contacting P.A. pharmacies next week to learn their policies. If they take unused drugs back for safe disposal, I'll congratulate and thank them. If not, I'll urge them to reconsider. I'll report my results to Ozias and Downey and press on until I'm happy with the outcome.
Actually I was shocked when she stated her opinion. I had always found this lady to be friendly, helpful, and nice. My husband and I were having lunch at the Senior Center and sat down to eat with her. We were so shocked, I didn't even voice my horror at her saying that black child deserved the abuse by that cop. Having talked with her (and served on a jury with her) I knew her love for children. Yet because this child was black she felt this little black girl deserved violent abuse by a cop. That is the whole point of my original comment. How can someone known to be loving and concerned about children, and the people in her (white) community be so uncaring and racist about black children? Do you suppose this Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde mentality present in so many white Americans is the reason so many of our institutions that should be color blind; such as Government, Religion, Criminal Justice, Healthcare, Education, etc., are in fact racist in word and deed? I absolutely believe it is!
The man has cancer, you jackwagon! Let it go! For one day, at least, let it f------g go! It is not your "citizen's duty" to pollute every available space with your dislike for the man.   You know, Andree, I used to think you were legitimately a public servant in your own right, bringing alleged ethical issues of Palin's administration to light. You've since done a remarkable job of putting that illusion to bed.
So what you're saying is you approve of American soldiers raping and sodomizing female prisoners at gunpoint, and hanging male prisoners from ceiling beams and beating them until they die of pulmonary embolisms?  So tell us, what did YOU do in the war, LW?  Oh, I forgot--you've apparently never been in the military.  All you do is besmirch veterans with whom you disagree.  Never mind.
The Country Faire...not the best example of something to promote here in Oregon...an unfortunate magnet for spirited acting out and related consequences. Not a place appropriate for children I feel. To be honest I have never been to the OCF but have experienced fall out from it as part of my job. Working in local health care over the life of the Faire the fall out and what presents to local health care facilities isn't pretty. Overdoses, injuries, general medical emergencies, psychotic episodes, dehydration, etc. Also the challenge of locating families is sometimes difficult, especially minors who are MIA from their families who come from other states. Long and short of it...as with many large "celebratory" gatherings it has a considerable dark side of risk which goes unmentioned in the "magical place" description.
Parental choice is a good thing; however, I'm concerned at the potential for a minority group of parents who insist on restricted sex-ed (such as abstinence-only) to force schools to exclude educators who present comprehensive sex-ed programs.  Parents who object to their kids being exposed to information about contraception and STD prevention should be able to keep their kids ignorant, although it's baffling to me why they would want to. I have heard the argument that such information encourages sexual activity, and it doesn't make sense. Don't these parents believe that their influence outweighs that of the school?  I have also heard objections to sex-ed classes discussing homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender persons, and other variations of sexual orientation and identity. These objections make even less sense. Aren't parents willing to have their kids learn the facts at school, then teach them at home the moral issues that they think apply to the facts?
... the above quote was parsed from a study performed in Australia: (c) Age at first anal sex and HIV/STI vulnerability among gay men in Australia - Anthony Lyons, Marian Pitts, Jeffrey Grierson, Anthony Smith, Stephen McNally, Murray Couch)(c) "Accepted - 10 December 2011; Published Online First - 12 January 2012"  http://factsaboutyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/Age-at-first-sex-Lyons-et-al.pdf  The education required by homosexually-active young men is quite important for both the life-long maintenance of good physical & mental health -- let's hope the Feds have ponied up Money for the impact of new Cdn laws with Federally funded 'Canada Health Transfer (CHT)' payments -- (c) "... the Canadian government's transfer payment program in support of the health systems of the provinces and territories of Canada....(citation: Wik)  . . .  therefore, how about we look at Cdn Human Health, first -- before the ever present cunning of politics c/w the Federal Liberal Public Relations campaign..
Video tapes show the non-complementatry gestures, vocal & physical comments on the so-called peaceful women's march, the day after the inauguration.
One thing is clear the Original Bovine Scatologist fits right in with your thesis.   BTW, did you know that Hitler was into it? What's a guy with one testicle and a small endowment to do?
A friend's son had this condition. Part of the well-baby examination that should take place at birth, and then be repeated several times during the first few months of life, is supposed to include checking to make sure the skull has not fused. While it is frightening for a new parent to watch a physician probe their child's soft head, it is done to diagnose this condition at the earliest possible moment.   A prompt diagnosis makes the treatment simple and nearly complication-free. Sadly, whatever pediatrician this couple used failed them and their child. In other states, this is malpractice. In Oregon, our level of medical care is so low that missing this standard check might not be below our expected standard of care.  While my friend's pediatrician also failed him, at least his condition was successfully dealt with. It involved placing hardware in the skull that allowed it to be slowly expanded, to prevent what happened to this child. Again, our level of care here is quite low.
I go downtown frequently for the Broadway Metro, the tap house next to the Broadway, Red Wagon Creamery, and the Farmer's Market; while I enjoy these activities, I am getting tired of having to step over feces, vomit, and passed out "travelers" on the corners of Broadway and Willamette.  I won't even go into VooDoo donuts because of the stench on the sidewalks just West of them.    Growing up I went to the Eugene Mall for shopping and the movies and never encountered what I do now.  I really looked forward to the revitalization of Downtown, but I am worn out by all of the travelers.  I am tired of having to walk into the streets because the travelers are sprawled out over the sidewalks leaving no room for anyone to walk.  Sometimes a person in a wheelchair doesn't have access to move around them and the travelers don't budge.    Some of the people on the mall are suffering from mental health issues, but the problems are with the travelers and not the mentally ill.
Regarding: "The fight over religious liberty was mishandled by the Obama administration, to be sure, but it was also mishandled by the bishops and it is clear they continue to make a hash of it." - Well, no. The Obama administration if anything was courteous to a fault to the USCCB. - What the administration should have said loudly and clearly was that the citizens want this insurance service, and yes, a lot of those citizens are catholics. So unless the citizens tell their government something else then this is the way it will be. - Had the USCCB been told this then they might have avoided 'trumping' up 'religious liberty' as a cause for themselves. Or then again, they themselves might have withdrawn from the healthcare ministries all together.
Coal heat for any purpose, but especially for electric generation, is as dirty as can be. The ash slurry ponds frequently overflow, killing all life in rivers and making municipal water supplies undrinkable. China is switching to wind and solar power at the fastest rate in the world because their air is poisonous from coal burning.  But the main reason coal is being phased out is because of the glut of natural gas we have. Natural gas is also cheaper to ship, is much lower in pollution, and has other advantages compared to coal. Sorry about those coal jobs, but we can at least say good-by to black lung disease and death from suffocation at an early age.
The Republicans had chances to repudiate Trump for over a year as Trump made fun of women, calling them names, made fun of people, apin them with disabilities, aping Clinton when she had pneumonia, openly advocating for racist policies. But they never did, they went along with Trump. Goes to show what kind of opportunists the Republicans are. And now they are rats jumping off the Titanic just before they hit the iceberg they've been watching for a couple hours. Trump is a sexual predator, and Republican leadership is, wink wink, condoning it, McConnell and his corrupt ilk for sale.  Even though Clinton is similarly ethically deficient, it looks like she will win by default. And this is coming from a undeclared voter.
Many servicemen/women were given the anti-malarial drug Mefloquine(Lariam) before being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The side effects include paranoia, psychosis and aggression,among others. The symptoms closely mimic PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury. The VA has advised its doctors to monitor veterans for symptoms. This drug is felt to be connected to several murders committed by returning veterans. British research showed symptoms can occur in as many as 1 out of 140. Symptoms can be manifested long after the medication had been discontinued.   Given that the government had denied the effects of Agent Orange and did not recognize PTSD as a legitimate illness for about twenty years after the war in Vietnam ended they do lack some credibility. Check it out, Lariam.
Ouch, that contortion must have hurt.  American voters just voted out the elites?  The uber-rich ARE an elite, um, like the Koch brothers, with all their influence on voters and politics? So you're gushingly welcoming the member of an elite into power while saying the elites are out, and it's a guy you just acknowledged said awful things about "women or people with disabilities or others” but you're going to put your feelings aside about that to gush about the non-elite who is an elite now in an elite position of power. Come on, you can come clean: it's his position on Muslim populations you kinda' dig, right?
A.T.:  Sorry, there must be something wrong with me...I haven't grabbed any women by the genitals (even when I was young).  I haven't mocked the handicapped.  I've run for office three times (State Rep., once...lost: school board, twice, won both times) and have never called an opponent "ugly".  I've never declared bankruptcy and I pay my debts.  I'll add a few more" I've never denigrated a person because of his/her race or ethnicity.   I've never accused another man of having a small male organ as a way of insulting him.  I've never entered a women's dressing room so I could leer at partly closed teenage girls.    I guess I'm just an old guy who's lived a really boring life...I know what I've done and what I've not done.  Call me a liar if you please, I don't really care about your opinion on this topic.  regards, Gary Crum
it is YOUR OPINION (mine as well, as well as probably 99.9% of the public).  a cousin of the charles family may have a different opinion - IT'S THEIR OPINION.  opinions are like fannys, everyone has one.  you don't seem to be able to get the core of what i am saying.  right or wrong in the description,  the RG has no right to use that word in a headline unless they are writing an editorial.  sorry dogbert - but it is what it is.  been that way for respectable newspapers.   been here almost 40 years - yeah - i think the guy in the wheelchair was the first drive by shooting here back in the 90's?  the family are anti social deviants.
Thanks. Probably they do sign waivers; however, that doesn't remove the potential public cost for providing for them if they become disabled from brain damage from an activity which requires extensive blows to the unprotected head.  (unless we want to put them on an iceflow).
Christians are in fact worse off spiritually then many liberal democrats for they unknowingly worship the man God Jesus Christ and his cross which is nothing more then Paganism/Idolatry or even a Yeshua in Messianic Judaism.
No lady, this is a black problem but your blind political correctness will not allow you to see it.  You know it, you just absolutely refuse to acknowledge it.  Our politicians and media are much too cowardly to acknowledge it so once again we will be forced to go down some insane road that has no chance of success.
They don't need a large LIO office that accommodates legislators. Scuttle the purchase idea.
like the nazis: those that were considered 'lesser than' the ideal. in their case Jews, Roma, Africans, and Slavs, the mentally retarded, the imperfect. we can add the old, the sick, with socialized medicine.
“African Americans” or Brazilian Americans", etc. would apply to those who came here of their own will after 1865. A more intellectually correct, color blind phrase for those who have descended from those who did not come freely from Africa before 1865, would be "Slave Descendant Americans".
Same old, same old.  The endless cycle.  We will now try to kill as many of them as we can.  They will then try to kill as many as they can.  Someday, the psychos will get their hands on a nuke and if the cycle has not been broken by then, there will be a very sad day.
mentally ill people really get no justice.  the "system" doesn't budge an iota in it's procedures and rules to accommodate a mental illness.  if you show up in a wheelchair, on crutches, with a white cane and a dog - they can help.  every disabilities group i've met almost always focused 90% of their program, meetings, etc to physical disabilities.  lip service is paid to mental illness - but that's about it.    sorry to hear ean has mental health issues. most people in these types of stories do. the woman that drove her SUV around inside the safeway store? is she sick?   very likely so... try to  understand the comments people make here are based on the story, as written.   sometimes family and/or friends get into the comments and they're very emotional, but no one else on here knows the young man, knows of his illness.  this situation does have a comical element - for whatever reason he was found covered in marshmallow stuff. i wish him well and all his advocates help him thru this.
Nope, nope nope. Just nope. Two different situations called for two different approaches.  If the subject with autism had been native, JPD's approach would have been no different. Same thing if Christopher had been white.   In this family's defense, it's so difficult to be in this situation. People are whispering in your ear, you're not sure what to think, and it's easy to feel helpless.
Yet another reflection on President Obama's tenure without even a whiff of global warming. When will genuine newspapers like NCR realize that they have a moral duty to shake us all till our collective teeth rattle, to ram us up against urgent reality? Pope Francis wrote a whole encyclical about it, for pity's sake! Climate change dwarfs every other news/legacy item by a factor of infinity, especially since 'the national whiplash from Obama to Trump' is apparently to be focused precisely on undoing this 'legacy', precisely at the most dangerous time ever for life on Earth.  If NCR editorial staff have such a gigantic blind spot, what hope can we have for the Trumps and Tillersons of this exquisite, and exquisitely fragile, planet?  Take positive action for a hopeful, sustainable and beautiful Earth in times of Trump. Please join us in a World INTER-Dependence Movement: http://paulbaker2004.wixsite.com/windyday - One Planet, One People.  Whatever about the buck - the PLANET stops here!
You forgot the taxes.  You would have to take in over 60K to clear $3,700 a month.  Unreal. If you or I went to Syria I doubt we would receive the same welcome.  Meanwhile we have the homeless, the lack of funding for our own handicapped not to mention the downward spiral of infrastructure and health care. I guess these issues aren't as sexy as being seen as charitable on the world stage.
Dude, you are making Neil's point for him. The report says that people who undergo incredibly rigorous scrutiny before being allowed to have guns are amongst the most law-abiding people. So that's pretty much a gun control measure having its intended effect of keeping guns out of the hands of bad people, which is Neil's point. I think you're trying to use that article to support some pro-gun agenda, but the meaning is quite the opposite.   I'm very much in favor of rigorous scrutiny being applied to each and every person who wants to own a gun.  That's gun control, and it works.
' except, of course, the journalist did not sensationalize this as something new,   …the journalist stated clearly that CDB has been around for 10 years.  .Quote:  "But in the past 10 years, scientists have concluded that CBD may be quite useful. Dozens of studies have found evidence that the compound can treat epilepsy as well as a range of other illnesses, including anxiety, schizophrenia, heart disease and cancer."  . Could be a lazy reader mischaracterized what the journalist did and what an article actually contained.
You make some interesting points but my comment was no joke.  I agree, I should not worry about what ppl say behind my back, as difficult as that is! Im personally not around many crude, gossipy women in my life but am sure they exist. Me and my friends dress fashionably and comfortably thank you very much :-)  I am mostly wondering how I should feel as someone seeking to avoid physical harm.   Often when men joke about sexual assault, and it is then normalized by the cultural term "locker room talk", it puts women like me at risk for physical harm. Not to mention how awkward it would be if the male coworker I am nice to and work with in the office was saying these things with other men at the office. Then if Im ever alone with him its actually dangerous as they are all choosing to look away and not protect me.
No dodge.  A direct answer.  Prayer has infinite effects, not always the physical ones we think we want, though many have been scientifically confirmed...healings incongruent with the known course of disease, etc.   But we have much better than "no writings from Jesus".  What's more important and believable:  what we say about ourselves or what others any others say about us?  And even better we have the testimonies of a tremendous number of lives in the early Church (some non Christian historians have estimated in the millions by the 350s AD or so.  How many martyrs?  I'll take the actual behavior of lives of this many people over what some Confucian-type wrote down about himself.
It's like Miss Lindsey said FOUR YEARS AGO:   “The demographics race we’re losing badly,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). “We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.”  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html
Hi James. As a domestic violence survivor, let me try to explain how it works. You don't go on a date and he slaps you pretty hard across the face and says "this is how the relationship is going to be, you ok with that?" It takes years of conditioning your victim. Starting usually with comments about how worthless you are. Women will believe that because what he said might be because I can't cook well, I left something out on the floor that made him slip, etc. After this, they point out that really nobody likes you, they are all usually his friends and they only put up with you because they love him. Believable enough when you rarely see the friends you had before, as isolating you from family and your group of friends is normally the case. How can we allow them to do that? It happens before you even realize what is happening. Then come the (usually) physical abuse. You didn't do this right, smack you around. It gets bolder, punching, kicking, etc. It happens over time.
Yeah, "shock and awe", to who, exactly, Welfare leeches? This has been coming for a decade, and people that think that this wasn't an inevitability are blind. It won't cause harm to this man's woman and child, because we don't live beyond our means...
One in 20 with ADHD ,  one in 100 with autistic spectrum , one in 5 with asthma .  What the heck is going on ? Air , earth  and water pollution I imagine. Not to mention bad diets.
LenG, do you honestly think that a woman who has an abortion does not suffer trauma at least equal to the trauma suffered by the man involved? I assure you, my former girlfriend suffered all sorts of trauma and grief. And where does your use of the word "faultless" come from? Where in my writing do I mention or even infer fault or blame of any sort? My attempt was to be objective and therefore blunt. Abortion is the killing of a living being, and that is an irrefutable fact. I do not state that abortion should be made illegal. Indeed, I stated, "our society is not good enough to make the killing that is abortion illegal in the usual way." I went on to make just one requirement: "The mother ... should be required to fully name her child on a public record before a legal abortion can be performed." It is an honor to name a child, not a disgrace or a horror or a punishment. My bet is: most mothers will choose to not kill a child they have named. Instead, they will let that child be born.
Lovely man, we loved helping him and chatting with him. Was sorry to see him ill and will miss him.
Exactly, resolution 2334 puts the Jewish quarter in Jerusalem as occupied territory in the same category as west bank settlements. Heinbecker's highlights the willful ignorance useful idiots at the UN by turning a blind eye to the pig-headed terrorists of Hamas in Gaza or the terrorist supporting leadership of Fatah, cowards who reward the families of terrorists after stabbing pregnant women while grocery shopping. The one-sided anti-Israel bias at the UN isn't a secret, it's pathetic. Look at what happened to Gaza after Israeli settlers left, it was turned into a terrorist staging ground for rocket attacks and kidnap tunnels by the rabid mutts of Hamas. Israelis have demonstrated that they will give up land in an attempt to reconcile but after what happened in Gaza, why would they negotiate with terrorists - both Fatah and Hamas teach Palestinian children perpetual hatred against Israelis, they don't want reconciliation, they want Israel gone, it's in the Hamas charter.
ChrisinAK You are missing the point.  If I run around throwing paint on people, then my actions are disturbing others.  Smoking spreads to others and causes headaches for many.  I'm a non smoker and I don't like smelling like cigarette smoke.  I grew up here and I remember 30 years ago coming home from many Anchorage bars smelling like an ashtray.  It use to be awful riding in airplanes recycling cigarette smoke.  You needed a shower once you landed.  I have many friends who smoke and I don't judge them for it. It's plain and simple, are my actions having an impact on others?  Cigarettes are proven to cause cancer.  Do we want our youth exposed to watching others smoke, so they think that may be a cool thing to start?  Hollywood and TV commercials use to glamorize smoking, however that has changed.  If you have a habit impacting others, then you may have to take extra steps away from others to continue your habit.   Anchorage bars banned smoking and business is still booming.
**The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions.** * Notice how the GM and Liberals promote the most harmful and addictive drug yet moralize about weed or fentalyn. Alcohol is actually more addictive than heroin! ` http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs349/en/
I hope he gets the Death Penalty and its carried out,  but here in Oregon its Unfortunately,  Extremely Unlikely, however, it would  Cleanse the Gene Pool......................  Any consolation????  He will DIE in prison.  Think of that young woman, what HORRIFIC, Mental, Physical Trauma and PAIN she went thru before he killed her.  This guy is a genuine "MONSTER", and deserves the ULTIMATE SENTENCE.................................
Once again commentators are as ignorant as the electors.  This is not a democrat v republican event. This is the elites v elites. Choose your elites - the ones you want to steal you blind and create laws that will erode your rights, your power, and your income.  All rich people are and have for many years been after your money. Now that they can buy elections and electors and votes they are going to wipe out the middle class. This election is about speeding up the process in a more crass and obvious way.
Go ahead and elect Trump...you ain't seen nothing yet....
More rank ignorance. People take drugs for a huge variety of reasons, and anyway, who are you to say they shouldn't? Most of the harms you're so concerned about not "enabling" are related to the illegal status of the drugs: overdose on unpredictable product, property crime, health issues, needle sharing... all of these have everything to do with the criminalization of drug use.  Oh, but it's so simple, is it? People should just choose not to use drugs? Well, maybe to start, sure--but are you really going to tell the street-living guy with health issues, no money, and little social support that you expect him to have the strength to wean himself off a masive addiction before you'll give him any help?  Please. If you think that's a realistic approach, you are completely blind to human nature and human suffering. Strength has nothing to do with it. Or, everything, when you consider the strength it takes to continue living like this, day in and day out. Try a little empathy next time.
I don't know you, I don't live there, but you can be the best driver in the world, you can be prepared for everything, have a perfect car, drive on a perfect road but there's always gonna be something that could happen. I hope everyone in your family always drive perfect & all there friends to. You should be ashamed a woman lost her life, a man may not live, and a child maybe suffer physical injury as well emotional pain for the rest of his life & this is what you say really? What happened to human kindness? Shame on you.
Alt-right?  I am a far left Socialist and I completely disagree with giving handouts to First Nations people born in the modern era. It is a shame what happened centuries ago and even the well intentioned but entirely stupid residential school system, but the fact is we are all in this together and you are not more special.  I have no idea how a child born in say 1995 is entitled to more than a non-FN child born in 1995.....what makes that kid more special except for racial considerations that we simply must move past.   If you are FN and younger than 65 give it a rest.....you are looking for a handout, not justice.  People like Paul Martin or Bob Rae might like to pontificate and sound all high and mighty but they are dupes nothing more.   White people do not look to other white people for inspiration, they look to what is best and the best people (ex. Ghandi/Jesus/Martin L King/FN belief in the earth), not the colour of one's skin.
He was in jail for acting out due to mental health issues.  Yes, hugging someone, grabbing someones butt and grabbing for body parts without their consent is sexual assault.  However, Mr. Bolus was mentally ill.  We don't hold diabetics responsible when their blood surgar plunges and causes them to  drive erratically like a  drunk on a 3 day spree, why do you think it's any different for the mentally ill?  In any case, he didn't deserve to die. From what I can see, the state was negligent.
Who is more marginalized than women?  Hmm--Alaska Native and American Indian students whose school leaders believe they can't learn?  Young black men who are automatically assumed to be criminals if they drive a nice car?  Legal immigrants who are assumed to be illegal?  People with disabilities?
Did you not understand the story? The bathrooms are ALL-gendered, not transgendered. In other words, all children in the school can use the same washroom, including the handicapped. In other words, where you needed four bathrooms in the past, one will now do. It's a cost savings, not a cost increase. You're welcome.
Well I'll be - it's a national event in October.   Like Breast Cancer awareness.   And I'm pretty sure that people care about that everyday instead of just the month of October.      Who knew:     http://nnedv.org/getinvolved/dvam.html
I merely pointed out that 90% of Black and Hispanic voters voted for Clinton. So if two of each had voted for Trump, you would say that "Blacks and Hispanics voted for Trump."? Either you are ignorant of facts, or you are trolling.  I think both, troll, spreading ignorance or trolling to irritate people, then making a childish wisecrack about Democratic voters. You are a troll. What does "bubbleguts" refer to, maybe your inguinal hernia?
Wrong again  Eric - the numbers are being deliberately skewed by Planned Parenthood themselves:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?utm_term=.8f89ccc434db  And if I am ignorant or deliberately lying, God's grace covers even the most heinous sin, you know nothing of God's grace so don't act like you do, but thanks for your concern about my well being - it means a lot and I am sure you said it with the utmost and genuine sincerity.  And how many girls who have sex at 10,12 and 13 are traumatized mentally, which leads to depression, anorexia, mental and physical disorders etc etc etc. I should not even have to go into, common sense reveals that.  And by the way - you never did answer that question about how the Big Bang or Evolution meets the definition of science. And my Children are NONE of your business - Do you hear me ?
The criminalization against, and discrimination of, people who have developed mental illness, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and other forms of brain illnesses must stop.  Ambulances are required to treat people who suffer acute symptoms from illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes, epileptic seizures, cardiac arrest, diabetic ketoacidosis, etc.  Yet, the police is required when people suffer from acute symptoms of traumatic brain injury, various mental illnesses, PTSD, etc.   Why the disparity in treatment of people who have illnesses that impacts the brain, rather than other organs?  Why do most people get immediate care and treatment from paramedics to mitigate, lessen and stabilize the acute symptoms...on their way to hospitals for further treatment?  Yet, another group who need immediate care and treatment get swarmed upon by police and swat teams...who only escalate, exacerbate and destabilize the situation more...are taken to prisons/jails to languish...or get shot at and die.
Both of your comments are excellent Kevin.  MSW is apparently blind to his own tendencies to engage in zero sum politics.  After all, it's not like the 'white working class' doesn't have their share of LGBT folks amongst their ranks.    I'm a bit confused as to why it's better to sell your economic future to a narcissist out of a sense of personal racial insecurity, than to accept a slower economic turn around in the hope of a more equal society for all.
Best wishes for his recovery.  As Bob is a devout Christian Scientist, I wonder how he felt about being resuscitated as well as his subsequent surgery.  Christian Scientists believe disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine, but by a form of prayer.  He must not have prayed hard enough.
Is it not true that the entire DWD procedure can be avoided by taking too many sleeping pills or other such medications?  ALS takes years to progress.  Stephan Hawkings has survived decades.  Maybe the troubles encountered stem partly from the lack of imminent disease related mortality.

I've just been made aware that the suspects, caught with a vehicle full of $3200 (per owner) worth of goods stolen in a local break-in, just got off with just about no penalties at all. This is part of a family with multiple convictions over the generations. However, the impounded vehicle (with the stolen goods inside) was released from impound to someone using a false address. The owner will never see his stuff again. The break-in artists are free to steal again. Now we neighbors are concerned that the brave person who followed and reported these professional thieves will be subject to retaliation. This is just a microcosm of the Mat-Su and Alaska justice system...mirrors the murder situation in this article. The reasons for not fully prosecuting miscreants is: Lenient ("too compassionate") District Attorneys; easy judges; and, the kicker: not enough room in our prisons. Violent offenders like Mr. Almeda are barely punished, allowing them to seduce and kill vulnerable young women.
Wrong on so-many levels!! Grr! It s people like you who don't respect the Vet, who by the way, has protected your right to type that paragraph! I dare you to go to the VA and spend just one day in the shoes of a Vet trying to get help. The U.S. Government made a promise to each and everyone who put their name on the dotted line - to take care of them for life! Please get off the Veteran rampage, as it takes an average of nine, yes I said nine, doctors for a Veteran to receive bennefits. I know, as I am a wife of a 100%  disabled Veteran, and can tell you the grief and aggervation Veteran's have to go thru. Go on, I dare ya. That man on the corner has a right. We may not care for the way he chooses to go "His" work everyday, but we will always have the poor with us. I find it hard to believe, that up here in Alaska the pan handlers are making so much money on a corner, that it affects our tax base. It could be You one day needing a hand.
How soon the left forgets about Paul Martin and his Canada Steamship Lines who placed his holdings in a semi-blind trust, later to be revealed that he received periodic strategic briefings from Howard Wilson, Mr. Chrétien's ethics counsellor. Hypocrites
Thank you, that was so good and true.  We're in the last stage of waiting, waiting for our Homegoing in God's best time.  Not necessarily the easiest time, with my husband persisting in fighting off the encroaching symptoms of Parkinson's, but we are together and have very supportive family.  And we have Jesus Christ as our Beacon of Hope!  So, again thank you and God bless you as you rejoice in this Advent season of joy.

If it's true that "you can't lead the people you deplore", then Trump cannot lead women; handicapped persons; immigrants; members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities.  Am I leaving anyone out?  Probably, but you get the idea.  Trump has demonstrated a profound and pervasive contempt for a stunningly large portion of the population of our country.
The offended tend to argue about speech as though it is all functionally and legally identical.  Using a university's internal resources, e.g. a web site, to express a viewpoint is not the same as expressing that view in a loud voice on the sidewalk or in a milder voice in the classroom.  Context matters.    Using the N-word in a class discussion of Huckleberry Finn is essential. It is impossible to excise one scene, in which a white woman expresses her pleasure that no one was hurt because only a negro was killed, and still teach Twain in a meaningful way, because the specific words are crucial to his way of pointing out hypocrisy. Using the same word out on the street in the face of a black person has no such purpose.   Most universities are run by the fearful today, and college leaders are unwilling to move slowly and carefully in responding to speech problems case-by-case in the face of political noise.  They instantly go to SweatCon 4 and flail about.  The result is usually bad.
Of course I do, Marty.  I only sought to highlight the negative aspects of the world into which they would be born, if in fact the victor is inaugurated and not sidelined by the court cases pending against him.  That's why we need to be sure that African-American and Latino/a babies, Muslim babies, babies with disabilities and girl babies are welcomed with love and ongoing support.  Peace.
Leaving the disabled, mentally ill and elderly out of this argument you still have a large population of people living in the woods. The ones that are doing most the damage are the people who are deforesting chunks of the woods for firewood, using the area as a personal toilet bowl and leaving large amounts of trash everywhere. Look at the picture of the guy smoking a cigarette and drinking a hot coffee from a gas station.
Mountain View gun battle; Minnesota Drive bullet to the head; Alaska Dispatch editor and wife bullet-ridden car just driving along the street.  Those 2nd Amendment rights are sure working out for Anchorage.  The blind, ideological purists will never admit defeat until their guns are pried from their cold, dead hands from a bullet(s) of fellow 2nd Amendment true believers.
Why did this guy move from Tampa? His sister is not willing to honestly help him. The most she will offer him is a floor to sleep on 21 days a year. A floor we pay for.  She's out nothing.  Now we got to house this guy too? We are expected to feed him provide medical, have him use resources from divisions like disability to get even more free stuff?  Our state cannot support the residents we have in need. Let's encourage out of staters with no intention or ability to contribute meaningfully to come on up. Great idea.
Don't forget one more group she offended greatly - People with Cancer!!  How low can you go?? smh
While I agree with dressing in a professional fashion I am not happy about being forced to wear heels. Sadly I have issues with my knees at a very early age and wearing heels is highly painful even for a few hours.  I have had men express that it is an expectation that I would be in heels at all times in the work place in order to garner more respect out of them. Not sure why. So for the last couple of months I have been icing my knees on a regular basis because of the expectation. Frustrating and sad that this is the case with so many industries. And I am in a financial institution type position.
And there you have it: Trump making promises on the campaign trail about things of which he is completely ignorant, and never even thought about. Then he talks with someone with a modicum of knowledge and voila! maybe he won't do the grotesque thing he promised his minions he was going to do; instead he'll "think about it." Meanwhile he's making Bizzaro World appointments of people to carry out as nihilistic an agenda--often personal--as I have ever seen.  People whose positions are about as extreme as you can get, and who will abuse any power they are given, regardless of the consequences to the country and the people who live within it. Bye bye social security, bye bye medicare, bye bye compassion and empathy, there's a new sheriff in town with a monstrous posse.  Tough luck grandma, grandpa. You cost too much to maintain, you've gotta go. Disabled? Pick up your tin cup and choose your corner. Orphaned? Trump has plans to put you to work.
Then why did they vote for someone more crooked, with less credibility, far less relevant experience, and obvious emotional and psychological issues?
Given the environment we are operating in, if Boyden says he's  a black, handicapped, trans-gendered, lesbian who are we to question they? Today you are whatever you say you are.
Motley: The Kennedy's have not been innoculated against "wackiness."......Here's a quotation from an article in Slate Magazine titled "The Conspiracy-Ridden Worldview of RFK Jr.  "Plait wrote a story about RFK Jr. for Slate last week, pointing out that the idea that vaccines cause autism is a crackpot theory that has been thoroughly debunked, that it is dangerous, and that RFK Jr. is one of its most effective proponents"  RFKJr is among the very, very tiny population of "vaccines cause autism" proponents.  That contention has been so debunked that only a few "die-hard" wackos still hold it.  RFKJr. is one of them.  It makes real sense that Trump would select him to chair a commission on "vaccination safety and scientific integrity"; every other appointment has been intentionally disruptive and counters science, why not add this to the list.  Nice choice, Donald.   Regards, and be very careful of thos flu shots!!!!!! Gary
Il Duce Trump's petulant, pursed-lip visage posing with head thrown back and nose in the air reflects his disdain for all others resulting in an ugliness far beyond any other humans.  His germanic genes ooze white supremacy grounded in the past ideology of his homeland bringing death and destruction to the entire world.  How much more needs to be learned to realize the peril posed by the ideological resurrection of fascistic master race control of this nation by a Republican party mentally and physically imploding into pure evil?
That certainly is what that bible verse says. What does it have to do with Mayor Berkowitz's Herculean efforts to make sure that more of the money I earn gets to the upstanding bums profiled in this story? I wouldn't want them to be deprived of their intoxicant of choice.
Clearly you have not suffered serious mental illness nor been close to people who have.  The ravages of psychiatric disoders such as serious depressionn, schizophrenia or addiction are profoundly life altering in  devastating ways.
Wavemaker.....from the video, the two officers definitely didn't have the suspect in any sort of detainment, they were still fighting him when they realized that he was going for a gun. Didn't you watch the video before you made your comment?? And everyone here understand that if this were two black officers shooting a black criminal, it won't even made the headlines.......
I believe the term is "straight white man".
lilboy10 just didn't work hard enough to better him/herself.
There was already a vote in the House of Commons this year which condemned BDS.  Does your blind hatred prevent you from reading clearly?
To get better results, we have to consider some changes.  Most Alaskans have some degree of vitamin D deficiency, and many have a blind, significant degree of deficiency.  It is not good to be deficient in vitamin D, but it is worse to be deficient and not know about it.  Vitamin D deficiency contributes to poor mental health.  Lack of nutrients cause mental and physical illness, yet we are not screened and treated for lack of nutrients before we are prescribed pharmaceutical medications.  Toxins, such as heavy metals mercury, cadmium, lead, and arsenic cause disease, and again we are not screened or treated for toxins before we are prescribed drugs.  Please read Nutrient Power by William Walsh, PhD http://www.walshinstitute.org/the-book.html.  The Mensah Medical Center http://mensahmedical.com has an 85% success rate treating depression, anxiety, ADHD, schizophrenia, alzheimers disease, and bipolar disorder using targeted nutrient therapy, and no pharmaceutical medications.  Thanks
I'm glad you brought this up, Mike AA. And there's more. As someone who has lost my husband to cancer and have been through the indescribable anguish and unbearable pain of sitting at the bedside of your terminally ill loved one you're about to have to let go, what I found particularly outrageous among the many new lows Trump has stooped to in the last few days: His call to terminally ill people to stick around long enough so they can vote for him on November 8. This man is devoid of even the smallest spark of compassion and decency.
Wavemaker, where did I state or demonstrate the slightest degree of bigotry?  Is simply criticizing a political advocacy group automatically 'bigotry' in your eyes?  Or can you simply not understand the difference between criticizing the political positions of a particular group vs. blind animosity toward the the members of that group itself?  PS: Your comment was gratuitously derogatory and uncivil, and I have flagged it as such.
They also may have been particularly unlikely to share their views with a visibly disabled, ethnically-mysterious-this-must-be-some-kind-of-brown outsider.  His ties to Imago Dei sank his campaign, IMHO. I am not alone in that opinion, as I do talk with a lot of other "Portland Progressives"...I'm more of a crotchety center-left sort. I'm not car-free or skinny or "not in East Portland" or "educated" enough to be a Real Progressive. And yet, in living rooms around town, those of hetero couples and gay ones, PoCs and white alike, the three big strikes against Bailey were his uncritical support of his creepy church, that he's done little for many of his platform elements like affordable housing on the County Commission, and, out here, his utter ignorance of East Portland.   I know, and am friends with, Mormons, Southern Baptists, etc. I used to be a Good Mormon Girl. I know shifty hate-filled churches when I see one, and Imago Dei is just that.
Thank you Patrick Harris for your service, your letter, and bringing The Wall to Eugene.  It was hard  not to  get choked up talking with  Vets there.   However, I have a different thought on your statement "This Wall, this very moving Wall, had an impact on so many because of the tumultuous times it represented that pitted a part of the population against the very people who had dedicated their lives to protect it. " While there were some stinking  fools in the anti-war movement who were hostile to our soldiers, more were critical of those "leaders" who sent  those men and women to fight-- and almost 60,000 to die--in a rotten war we should never have been involved with.  It was pure blind luck that I ended my own Cold War  service, after a couple of happy years in Germany, in 1961  shortly before Viet Nam got  hot.  Otherwise....But I'd been opposed to our policy in Viet Nam even while I was in the army and was crushed to see all those casualties, including Vietnamese, later.
I have never seen any elected Republican willing to "Work together" with members of the Democratic party to get things accomplished that they were elected to do, represent the people who voted them into office, not just the wealthy, big corporations, or corporations. A democrat mayor Berkowitz announces Anchorage will see a $14M surplus in 2015. Some of it could be attributed to no snow.  Republicans are the only ones trying to eliminate the vote for women and minorities. There are people who can't see that Republicans are in office to further their own agenda, not the interests of the people who voted for them. Dumb and blind people are easily lead and manipulated.
walker doesn't even know how many people are working for the government. if he would demand an accounting of every person who works for the government and the amount they get payed, he could make BIG changes right there. and if he ran every employee through ice, he could find out how is working here illegally. they could save a lot of money by cutting what they are paying people who have turned their homes into homes for the disabled. they are making anywhere from $6000.00 pre person a month, or more. thats coming from the budget. there are anywhere from 4 to 16 people living in these homes. most of these homes are being run by muslims.
If one of their children were to develop a life-threatening illness, and 99 out of 100 doctors told them they can save their child but the cost would be enormous, and one doctor said there is nothing wrong,  what do you suppose would happen?  Does the child live or die?
Good Samaritan Work is not such a blessing. The authors of The Spirit Level showed that an increase in the wealth of a developed country does not lead to better living conditions as this article, and most business articles assume. Rather they show "that for each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child well-being, outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries, whether rich or poor." (Wiki).   As a country do we want more wealth or better living conditions? What I  found truly amazing is that Japan, an economic basket case, is tied with Sweden as the best place to live, based on the above factors. There is correlation between living conditions and income inequality across 23 developed countries. No explanation, just data. Solid.  .
You had language skills and a good Canadian education, they do not, particularly not when they are single mothers with five kids, two disabled.
Here is one for all you who think the police shouldn't be on the streets checking people, especially groups of males with no reason to be hanging about.  Just finished dinner with my brother and his family.   My nephew, 16 years old, was walking home after work at a local restaurant two Saturday nights ago. This was in Coquitlam, a suburb of Vancouver.    3 young males ethnicity/race unknown approach him, one strikes him across the face with an umbrella and they rob him of his cell phone and his new jacket.  Unfortunately for them, he is 6'2, a lacrosse player and a provincially ranked judo competitor.  He chased the one guy down, threw him to the ground and retrieved his phone.  A second attacked him and ended up getting a few good punches to the head.  They ran off.    Now, the blow with the umbrella left him with a injured eye, not serious. So,  is there anyone among you who would suggest that police would not have been justified to stop this trio and ask their purpose prior to this
That's a crappy position to be in  and you shouldn't have to be in it.  But it's also time to consider whether the PFD really makes us blind to the fact that wages have been declining precipitously here for decades, while we have skyrocketing health costs and tuition.  You shouldn't have to work two jobs and your daughters' jobs shouldn't be supporting the family.  The PFD has been a crutch supporting bad employers and poor wages.  It's long since past time to examine that problem, and fix it.
As was I. For these folks, the right to life begins and ends at birth.  After that? 'Not my problem.'  I shudder to think what these people will do, and who they will blame, when the coal mines aren't re-opened, factories aren't re-started, steel mills aren't blazing once more,  and mom and pop stores don't once again line the streets of every town.  It will likely be a bloodbath.  I truly hope that the west coast states (and northeast states) will pursue secession.  This way those who think that a man who mocks a disabled reporter in front of cameras is presidential material, can have their country back, and the rest of us can move on.
Not all women candidates get the third degree about their health. None of the mainstream press (left or right leaning) asked a single question about Sarah Palin's health, mental or physical. In retrospect they probably should have. Amazing how a half pound of make up and Naughty Monkey shoes can throw reporters off a real story. Good to see the RNC is taking the vetting of their recent candidates a lot more seriously, not. Don't get me goin' on Don Trump's or Don Young's fitness to serve. Teflon Don's indeed....
The prosperity gospel is an old wolf in new sheep's clothing. It's essentially the same nonsense that Jesus dealt with when the Pharisees argued that the blind and lame were being punished by God (and, by implication, that they themselves were God's favored). It's reared its head throughout history under different guises and in nearly every religion and culture, including slavery in the pre-Civil War U.S. and the caste system in India. And let's not forget how literally the Catholic Church has, at times, taken the notion that our hierarchy are "princes."  What it all boils down to is that people like living comfortably but they don't like being reminded that other people pay for their comfort. If you can con yourself into believing that God wants you to be rich but is fine with your neighbor being poor, then presto -- the good life with no guilt!
Our consitution needs to be revised to make gun ownership a PRIVELAGE, not a right. If you have a criminal record or suffer from some sort of mental illness or depression, you should lose that privelage. The only people who are killing people with guns are criminals and psychos.
Not sure what survey the DA Assoc is referencing to support its self-serving claim that DAs "are in touch with their communities".   Also not sure how they are defining "communities";  the county where they were elected? The Black community?  The Latino community? Native Amercan community? Wealthy white Republicans? Recovering addict community? Communities of the formerly incarcerated and their families? Parole, Probation, Jail and Prison staff? Police and sheriffs?  Disabled community? GLBT community? Communities of people who raise chickens?  Collect rocks? Count birds? Local NRA chapters? Affiliated marijuana dispensaries? Water sports enthusiasts?  Christian fundamentalists? Bridge and Scrabble playing community?  Have only met one DA who represents any of the communities of which I'm a member. As a group they tend to be punitive and sanctimonious, routinely pursuing options which ravage lives rather than enable atonement, restore the community, or reflect true justice.
As a special needs mom whose kid goes to Bridgeway House it makes me sick that someone would sue them for this enormous amount of money.    Bridgeway House does so much good for so many families in our community and it is a shame to see people suing them for this enormous amount of money.  $600,000 for her son might be wonderful for her, but it also takes money away from a school that provides education and opportunities for families affected by autism in the community.  One of the few places that has the ability to serve kids with more severe autism behaviors.   THAT makes me ill.  Sorry, IF (and that's a big questionable IF) there was any negligence, I could see her suing for $10k in medical expenses.  Maybe even a couple of thousand for pain and suffering.  But $600,000 is way out of line.  My son has injured himself during meltdowns more than a few times.  Never once have I tried to get rich off of it.
And just how many women were in the military during Viet Nam? They didn't draft women so it wasn't a matter of avoiding the draft like Trump did with his lame excuse of shin splints.
99% disagree with me? Site the source for that statistic. Those Canadians that can afford it come to the U.S. for treatment if they have a major health issue because you could die waiting for treatment in many parts of Canada.
I notice ADN turned off the comments on the vaccination article. It's really a shame since vaccinations without insurance, can cost over $1000.   http://children.costhelper.com/baby-immunization.html  Just think of all the babies that won’t have vaccine-related autism or ADHD, because they’ll be dead! Not to mention all the adults who can peacefully die of measles or whooping cough contracted from someone who couldn’t afford insurance, safe in the knowledge that at least the government didn’t take any of their money to pay for that person’s health care!
Great businessman huh?  Have you really looked at his bankruptcy history?  One personal and three businesses. That means all the suppliers of  goods and supplies were ripped off.  Hired a whole crew from Poland to build Trump Towers and never paid them.  Closed nine failing businesses.  Don't forget the "missing" $6 million in contributions for disabled Vets--never got there! He sure is taking you for a ride!
The Trump supporter points to Clinton's support for legal abortion as the reason she can't vote for her, yet Trump's support for the death penalty is a line she CAN cross?  Seems she's either confused or cherry picking from the sanctity of life bucket.  And how does she reconcile Catholic views on the marriage & family with Trump's? Of the two, HRC is the only one who has remained faithful to her original marriage vows, while Trump's broken all 3 of his.  Both candidates give Catholics reasons to be troubled.  But it's dishonest and lazy to fall back on "my Catholic faith" as she does here.  If sanctity of life and the family matter, we can't selectively enforce rules against one candidate but not the other and be taken seriously.  And Trump mocking the disabled reporter signals respect for the disabled to her? Huh?!  "I morally cannot vote for HRC. She is an advocate for Planned Parenthood and my Catholic faith requires me to value life no matter how small or old or disabled."
The author of this excellent piece is too circumspect to actually say that "the new president of the greatest nation on the face of the earth" is himself the best illustration of the lack of reading skills that "far exceeds anything else that is curbing America's growth potential."  If Mr Trump's performances in debates and on Twitter are any indication, he himself is almost inarticulate ("terrific," "horrible," great," "disaster," and so on). His reading-list seems to extend no further than his own press clippings, and his CEO-like imagination is terminally walled-off at monetary wealth. It fails entirely to make the all-important leap from sheer blank materialism to moral generosity and magnanimity.  "Others, you say? Nonsense!" Beggar-thy-neighbour is the name of Trump's game. He seems to be blind to any other form of riches.
Slow down after dark. Drivers in South Central routinely speed and drive reckless. I have experienced it too many times. The worse the conditions the faster and more reckless they drive. They are an inconsiderate lot. Not only do they not care about moose they could care less if they kill you trying to save a few seconds.  The study should be about why people think they have the right to endanger everyone else with their deadly weapon vehicle. And those super bright lights? Hey, they are great for you but they blind everyone else traveling the other way you selfish, inconsiderate clod. The proof is already there. Record number of fatalities in 2016!  But what do you care? You have full coverage and airbags all the way around. Save more lives; raise alcohol and cigarrete taxes and hit the gas Anchorage.
Mitt Romney thinks Trump is untrustworthy and unethical:  “His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn’t create it.”  "I am far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament of be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter’s questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity."  "Donald Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, while has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good."

You claim to care about those unaccompanied minors -- but you supported a man who boasted he would kick out the ones that were here and build a wall to keep them out, when he was president.   You claim to care about that child with Down's syndrome -- but you supported a party that has made clear their intent to cut the social safety net for the disabled and the elderly, when he was president.  You claim to reach out to all, in service for the "common good" -- but you supported a man whose campaign was based on the demonization and belittlement of blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, immigrants of all backgrounds, the disabled, veterans, women, gays.  In all sincerity, your words are blind, self-serving, and meaningless, and you hope we will forget what you did and said then.   We will not forget.
As we all know, a random roadside sobriety test takes place every time a police officer speaks to a driver or observes him in action. Following that, if his suspicions warrant, the officer will require a breathalyzer test.   The analogous steps take place prior to each and every departure of an airline flight. All crew members interact with one another in highly coordinated and legally mandated ways. A crew member who does not have the capacity to fly safely is readily detected, just as the police officer spots an intoxicated driver. At that point the other crew members will intervene, just as they did in the SunWings case.  Crew members will intervene regardless of the reason for the incapacitation, be it alcohol, physical health problems or anything else. Each and every one of them is in the same plane as the passengers., and they all want to go home to their families.
Today I observed a man walking on short legs at the Palmer Alaska USA Credit Union.  I guessed that he had been a soldier injured by an IED in Iraq or Afghanistan, but when my friend returned to the car, I learned otherwise.  He was in a car accident caused by a girl on a phone in her car, running into him, causing him to lose his legs from the knee down.  Shut off or don't answer your phone when you're driving.  It is hard to imagine what the idiot girl feels like, being guilty of costing the man his lower legs.
Nearly 1/3 the cost of my new hearing aids.
Reminds me of that time when my friends tried to kick Sally out of our club just because she wanted to bring her dolls into the tree fort.  Silly little minded kids. This must mean he isn't a self-righteous sheep that belongs to one of those evangelical clubs in the valley. Oh my God! He must be a communist! Where is Joe McCarthy?
The lady suffered a broken leg due to the PIT BULL.  Did that escape your notice in reading the article we are commenting on?  smh
EMF sensitivity is nonsense.  Right up there with autism caused by vaccines and the gluten sensitivity fad.  I know many EMF neurotics will be incensed, but I really don't care about the opinions of science-free people.
Similar to the U.S. where men like the USCCB and those in the U.S. Senate and House of Reps,.......can't seem to mind their own business when it comes to women's health issues.
This Minister is talking out of her azz.  Canada has no such technology to sell to the world. We are going to end up paying more, and the political class are going to have a big party at our expense.  When the party's over, Canada will have 25% unemployment like France and other moribund socialist economies in Europe.  The loss in manufacturing will be particularly egregious.   We look at the situation in Europe today, and as Canadians we should decry the oppressive taxation in Europe. 20-25% VAT including food. This is not a model for Canada, and I hope this dangerous leftist alignment in politics is changed before it's too late.
Scripture scholar Jose Miranda would take issue with you over the "poor you will have with you always" quote. It is a mistranslation. The word for 'always' is used several times in the NT and on EVERY other occasion it is translated as 'still.' He maintains that it is a deliberate mistranslation, accepted by the hierarchs in order to present poverty as an ever present necessary evil and to relieve them of any urgent responsibility of committing themselves to doing something about it. Incidentally, he also challenges their deliberate corruption of Jesus' words about his kingdom. Miranda claims that they deliberately present God's Kingdom as some other worldly reality placing it in the hereafter whereas for Jesus it was clearly a present reality. Your final sentence is quite bizarre. Francis has actually been excellent at flagging up the sins of this world from rampant capitalism to racial prejudice to religious hypocrisy. Some just don't like him so they play deaf.
Yes I have a child.  He was almost killed by a mentally unhinged addict and has permanent disabilities as a result.   I also have a conscience and a penchant for justice, unlike so many on these pages who fantasize about the defendants being beaten, anally raped until they die, hung publically so they can see them lose control of their bowels when they die and on and on. Do you think your child couldn't do something reprehensible? If he or she did, how would you feel reading these types of comments that are not only directed at the accused, but at their parents and families?  I've read countless horrific comments about this case, most of them from people who don't have much in the way of facts or true compassion, but rather excel at a mob mentality that extols the worst violence imaginable.
Sometimes being colorblind is a good thing.
Sorry tRump and tRumpettes, but it's too late.  Too much of tRump's lame brain comments have resinated and nobody is about to forget tRump proclaiming that his bedroom was his Vietnam, he knows more than the nation's generals about ISIS, if he shoots someone he'll still get votes, making fun of a disabled reporter by stupidly convulsing behind a podium, mocking women and anyone with black or brown skin etc. etc.  Noooooooo, tRump.  It's over and you know it.
Here a list of scientific studies that show a link between vaccines and autism, disproving the myth that no official research papers exist to support what alternative doctors have been saying for years. (the actual list is 40 studies long this is just a smattering hoping that it will act as a catalyst to updating your information on this issue  Parents want to know if their child can develop autism from their vaccines. If they believe that the answer is yes, and the risk of brain injury from vaccination is higher than their risk from a disease, it is their right to decline vaccination for themselves and their children with out coercion.  1.

He was the world's most famous Sunni Muslim.  And he was anti-war.  Think how much more he could have done for the cause of peace if he had stopped fighting earlier...before he got "pugilistic Parkinson's."  Perfect example of an athlete who didn't know when to quit.
Creating a team that is expressly for homosexuals, is to condone a team that expressly excludes homosexuals. If one party cannot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, no one can. If one party can discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, everyone can.  Imagine if there was a team comprised entirely of heterosexual men, who openly declared their heterosexuality, declared they would play against homosexuals, but would not permit them to be part of the team. People would lose their bloody minds. The outcry about a minority group being denied access would be deafening.  That's your litmus test, folks. If it's not ok for one group to do it, it's not ok for the other group to do it.  And this is a hockey team. They're playing hockey. People get put on their butts, put into the boards. Once in a while a fight actually breaks out. They're willing to endure the physical nature of the game, but... don't hurt anyone's feelings. Really?
First, the far greater hate of everyone not white and male, wealthy, not Christian, physically disabled, or a "loser" who died in war? Those are the people Trump calls "losers", and with his power, that is truly hateful.  Enjoy your visit with your family, Tired. I am recently returned from a visit with my family, which includes women, physically disabled, war heroes, Christians and Buddhists, and Asians, African-Americans, and Hispanics, as well as Norwegians.
Speak for yourself. No more of this "we the people" BS. No one in my family or circle of friends does drugs. Living a degenerate lifestyle is a choice! Addiction doesn't just hide in the bushes waiting to jump out at people. Yeah it's a "sickness" but it is a series of choices that leads to the "disease."  The only way this affects me is when my mail gets stolen or I have to call community patrol to scrape a passed out junkie off the sidewalk.
You must not have read the comments on Shannyn Moore's commentary yesterday then.
Just an excuse to soak more tax dollars, they need to join the rest of the country not hide in desolation.  Yes Chrétien said it best  " MOVE "
Ten years ago, my husband developed an autoimmune form of arthritis. We knew what it was because his mother has it, but since we were not insured - I was in a waiting period before qualifying through my work - and preexisting conditions would place a yearlong hold on coverage under my employer's insurance plan, we did not dare go to a doctor until we were covered. Because of this, he spent a year suffering from an untreated degenerative disease that left him barely able to walk. He spent most days sitting in a chair. Once he was diagnosed, and after the insurance company had (literally - we heard about it from friends) called every relevant doctor in town to confirm that he had not been diagnosed before, he received treatment that changed him from chair-bound to walking overnight.   My husband has a chronic disease. Treatment is prohibitively expensive without coverage. A return to lifetime limits and preexisting condition clauses could make him uninsurable. We need the ACA.
Life itself is a gift from God.  You’re confusing the use of the gift - “consists in the ability to put one's sexuality at the service of God's people” - with the gift itself.  One of my very best friends was born with cerebral palsy. He considered that a gift from God.  "And how did Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchitt... "As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember, upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see."
It's interesting that the government's most vocal and totally misinformed critics all seem to hang out on the G & M's comment section. Some very important stories in the news get very little response from readers but any chance to make homophobic comments about the P.M.'s hair, physical appearance and past job experience are simply too good to miss.
Toxoplasma gondii becomes a permanent lifetime parasite in your mind, making you blind, or even killing you when your immune system becomes compromised by disease or chemo and immunosuppressive therapies. It can last over 18 months in any soils or waters and not even washing your hands or garden vegetables in bleach nor hydrochloric-acid will destroy the oocysts. During dry-spells of weather (or inside low-humidity homes) when the oocysts become dessicated you can even contract T. gondii by just inhaling the air wherever any cats have defecated and the oocysts have become airborne/aerosolized. Contrary to your self-deceptive myths, a cat can become reinfected many times during its life and spread millions of oocysts each time. It’s now also linked to the cause of autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, IED, memory-loss, and brain cancers; as well as increasing the suicide rate in women almost 2-fold even though they’ve never suffered from any mental or emotional health issues previously.
Another sicko. When a man chooses to hit a woman he is no longer a man.
rocky, are you the kalani that i talked to several times sitting on the wall by the palace, under the banyon tree with the hawaiian flag wrapped around him? i hope not, because that kalani told me its ok to kill anyone, even kids (his exact words), that arent Hawaiian, if it will restore the kingdom? no matter, i know this rocky, if parents teach their kids to hate, that it is ok to discriminate against minorities, other religious groups, poor people, women, gays, transgender persons, the handicapped, foreigners or anyone different than themselves,that in 2016, it is wrong.  292ce, 1093ce, 1493ce, 1793ce and 1893ce are past, they are gone. forever.  Caesar, Genghis, Napoleon, Kamehameha are gone.   children on this planet need parents that teach them how to respect others and accept life as it is in 2016.  urge officials to get tablets and free WiFi into every child's hands so they can find out for themselves, the unbiased truth about the world they are growing up in.
Save your breath. The truth is wasted on the willfully blind.
St Vinnies try's the very best they can. They give drug tests before you are eligible for the camping program.  I know this because I have used the camping program. I am not addicted to drugs. I worked for a school for four years with children with disabilities. I have paid taxes. My husband lost his job and ultimately in the end our family ended up living out of our car. We have small children. If it was not for the help of st Vinnies our family would still be sleeping out of a car in random parking lots. Which is extremely unsafe. Saying all homeless are deadbeats or drug addicts is wrong. He who is perfect shall cast the first stone. Wait, no takers? No one is perfect? Didn't thinks so. St Vinnies is a wonderful organization. Just because there may be a few bad apples doesn't mean the whole bushel is bad. Not to mention we have no idea what happened till the autopsy report n what ever happened to innocent until proven guilty? St Vinnies provides a great service
Clinton has spent decades in public service since 1973 to be exact. She deserves to be on that stage tonight as the first women candidate of a major party. And what where you doing in 1973? I was in Boston working at a major hospital clinic providing health care to the indigent and homeless and Hillary was in New Bedford , MA. , not far from Boston, knocking on doors looking for disabled children who had no way to be educated and go to school at the time.  Hillary, a new attorney, chose that instead of a prestigious law firm. These children were not "mainstreamed" at all in public schools. I lived that time, we wanted to make a difference and still do. Thanks to those like Hillary my grandson who is 5 is autistic and is receiving his education in a public school with the help of his teachers and his classmates. He is a remarkable brilliant child who feels secure and reaching for his potential. People who commit to Public Service never quit or give up on anyone.
Polyps no big deal. The GE just snips them out and sees you again in 5 years. You want your polyps to be under 10mm and have less than 3 to hugely enhance the chances of them being benign. Of course there are bum luck genetic exceptions, but otherwise the condition of one's colon is vastly about what you swallow.
True. Atrocities have been committed in the past under the banner of religion.  A judgment against the whole for the crimes of a few is not justifiable.
Replying to myself here, because I just looked it up: for those who don't know, Ryan Bundy was run over by a car as a child, and it caused permanent nerve damage and face paralysis.
I disagree with your anonymous opinion that Ms.Patkotak "seems to have very little knowledge about kids with special needs."  Readers of her previous columns or her first book already know of HER professional experience.  But readers cannot confirm an anonymous poster's expertise.  .       Next, given your specific claim, it would have been useful to cite ANY study confirming that "it's more often than not that the [special needs] child's mom was not on drugs or drinking or that [his/her] home life caused the child's behavior or disability."  .        However, Ms. Patkotak did NOT say that "more often than not" a special-needs kid's behavior or disability IS caused by her mother's drug/alcohol use or her crappy home.  No, she rightly noted that SOME kids' special needs result from genetic chance or other unavoidable bad luck BUT there are ALSO kids whose disabilities HAVE been caused by their mothers' behavior during pregnancy and/or by their parents' violence (or extreme neglect)..
Trump's ascension was a direct result of Tea Party, evangelical, and white backlash against disorderly Blacks, Mexican immigrants, a decline in sexual mores and rise of gay marriage. It has been harbored and nurtured as anti Obama and anti woman (especially Hillary Clinton) hate. But most important, it has fostered a hate for the poor, the disabled, the homeless, the sick, the aged, and anyone else in need. These needy folk have been disowned as "unworthy" of our concern and suffering from self-inflicted troubles. There is then no mercy - it is their fate until they pray themselves up from their own boot-straps.
Just tax the rest of the producers out of business, after running for a political office, like Jay Hammond, who clearly mentioned today as a reason to hold on to the original income tax statute. It can be tough to see beyond the end of your nose, an Alaska Political fact, now playing with blind men elected consistently, for over 40 years.  When you look at 40 years, to money tossed down the sewer, always look for the reason, in Joe Juneau's Gold Mine. Get drunk and Vote!  "If, for instance, a man is born hasty and awkward, is always having accidents and hurting himself or his neighbors, no doubt his congenital defects will be allowed for in the courts of Heaven, but his slips are no less troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprang form guilty neglect. His neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper peril, to come up to their standard, and the courts [that] they establish decline to take his personal equation into account." Oliver Wendel Holmes Jr.
Have pre-existing medical conditions? No insurance? No problem! Just head to your nearest business and lie your butt off. Take your place amongst the countless frivolous lawsuits that bog down our nation's system. Atta girl!
Yes, Jesus was very fond of racist pussy grabbers who mock the disabled.
And we have had eight years of Bill Clinton and now Obama to set things right, how has that worked out, I didn't see any improvement whatsoever in advancements for the chronically mentally ill.     Presidents are simply the front men for those that truly run this country, and if anyone thinks that they see the average citizen as anything but numbers on a ledger they are kidding themselves.
He was put in mental jail for grabbing women's _________.
This is only yet one more glaring example of how the state of academic discourse at universities in Canada is a complete farce. People running universities all across the land ought to be ashamed of themselves. I just finished watching video footage of that hard core racist Yusra Khogali hurling racial slurs at a black man on the U of T campus at freedom of speech rally. Universities are dangerous places when prominent members of their student political bodies are allowed to run around the campus oppressing members of minority groups with blatant hate speech and university administrators do nothing about it. A clear human rights violation, on a university campus yet administrators turn a blind eye? No, somethings wrong in the world of academia and the people running that fiasco have no business in trying to form solutions to it. They'll make their safe spaces but make no mistake. At the university of Toronto, that black man who was clearly a victim of a hate crime, should not feel safe
Ak Joe - PLEASE don't be offended, I understand why you would feel disrespected, I really do. Personally, I am offended by religious groups who refuse to pledge. I have HUGE issues with the military! I hate the way our government treats those that serve. Lack of proper medical care is atrocious. I hate the high suicide rates of our returning vets. I hate how once you join they own you, for those that can't take it, they can't leave & jailed for AWOL. I hate that we are fighting other people's wars but they tie our hands because of "rules of engagement". We have AK soldiers still in military prison because they were ordered too shoot and when it turned out they were civilians their CO's lied.  Our military men & women sacrifice so much, family, mental health, truama, injury and even death and the way we treat these heros is horrible.    "...with liberty and justice for all."   LEO brutality, racism, hate crimes and failing to take care of our military vets isn't justice for all.
One officer supervising up to 60 prisoners is not constant supervision.(maybe more) It is not a one on one operation of constant observation. Even on 15 minute checks a successful suicide may occur. That and all deaths are not suicides- unfortunately prisoners die of strokes, heart attacks and other diseases as well as drug related conditions.. They may not be driving on icy roads but they are housed closely with other folks , some of whom are violent, many mentally ill, all under stress where the potential for violence against others ot oneself is immense. Not sure how correctional staff are responsible for that but I am sure you will find a way. I don't know if all procedures were followed here- I hope they were- but even when everything is done correctly tragedies can still occur.
Beverly,  I don't believe in abortion as a birth control measure but I am Pro-Choice.  If a woman has a health issue complicated by pregnancy to the point of potential death, who are we to deny her the right to save her life?  This health issue could be physical or mental, her treatment should only be decided between her and her doctor.      Life doesn't always work out so smoothly for some adopted babies, this does not mean that women should not carry an unwanted baby to term for adoption, it just means that every adoption does not result in a "picture perfect" life for the baby.  Sometimes the mental deficiencies of the rapist who impregnated his victim pass onto the baby born out of the rape.  How do you reconcile that with the rape victim?      It is not our "right" to decide for another woman her medical decisions or procedures; and, yes, abortions are medical procedures that should be decided by the woman and her doctor, not you, I, or the guy standing in line next to us.

Interestingly, the kids with the healthiest teeth in Clallam County live in Sequim, where the water has never been fluoridated.  The kids with the worst dental health live in Forks, where the water has been fluoridated for many decades.    You've been told a heck of  lot of kids have been helped, but when the epidemiologists actually study the results, turns out there's no "there" there.  That's why almost all the countries in Europe  --  where the governments provide health and dental care to their people  --  have stopped fluoridating their water.
No, I'm not blind. Which site did you find these claims under? Mush Limbaugh? FOX Noise?
Actually, not that easy. I have learned the hard way that every person you meet, regardless of age, race, gender, religion, or political leaning might be a threat to your safety. Sounds extreme, but people like to typecast their villains and those that mean you harm don't necessarily follow your script. Remember the old guy in a wheelchair that murdered a guy in Spenard back in the 90s? Just a harmless old geezer, until he got mad and shot the dude over something stupid. Or the woman that had too much to drink and stuck a rifle in a guys chest out in Emmonak. Or the kid that murdered his stepmom on the Hillside? You never know.
Mention was made of the fact that doctor's visits are so brief there's no time for these discussions. THIS is the real problem with the Canadian illness care system (no, we do not have a health care system). Doctors' offices are run like Mcdonald's franchises where the goal is simply to run as many people through as possible. More than one issue to discuss? Too bad!   A close friend had what turned out to be pneumonia and a fractured forearm. She was treated for the pneumonia and told to make an appointment to discuss the arm. She ended up in Emergency. If it were me I would have found a good lawyer and sued.
Miss Ann Thrope, you will be amaze at the level of understanding, scholarship and knowledge we humans have on each other. You should read some more and read books that make you uncomfortable because they challenged your comfort zone. You are talking about African slaves that came in several decades after the founding of Jamestown. What you appears to forget is that the first blacks that was brought ashore came from a captured Spanish slave ship. English had no real history of black slavery before this so they took them in as indentured servants like many of the whites who there as well. Most of the initial  indentured blacks were freed later on. They form the core of free black Americans until the ending of the Civil War in 1865. Do you not know your nation's history, Miss. Thrope? Of course, it is important to understand that without black slavers, there cannot be black slavery in the United States.. Are you that blind to the obvious? Black slavers enabled white racism!!! Ironic??
Aren't you the least bit apprehensive about what a politician says? You should be. Allowing personal choice to blind you to reality is a dangerous place to be. As a Liberal supporter, I maintain healthy skepticism about the direction Mr. Trudeau and the federal government are taking.
Okay,  Is it just me or is anyone else looking forward to the return of feminine  hygiene and erectile dysfunction commercials again after the election? I have to admit I'm really confused though, I can't decide which product I should be stockpiling K-Y or PreparationH?  We're going to need one or the other, maybe even both, regardless who wins the election.
not everyone can help, despite desperately wanting to.   not everyone is physically or psychologically capable of providing grandma's treatment.   not everyone is financially positioned to provide grandmother's treatment. here's the thing...i'm willing to pay for and participate in a health care program for everyone, including YOUR grandmother.  that means in the event that YOU are not able to provide it, grandma will still get the treatment she needs.   as to that smarmy 'shame on you'...esadmofo.
Exactly, Canadian troops are well trained to face any situation, however the Canadian government is not capable, trained, interested and what have you to support and take care of troops when they come back physically and or mentally injured   Instead, they challenge them in court see the Equitas case. Canadian Government refuse to honor the Sacred Obligation to care for wounded troops upon their return home.
Milions of people have been harmed due to water fluoridation with neurodevelopmental disorders (ADD/ADHD, Autism) and endocrine damage (thyroid, pineal gland etc.). Fluorides were known central nervous system intoxicants already in the 1930's, when Kaj Roholm published his studies. This is why Sarin gas is a fluoride.
The R-G editors are tone deaf.   They still see problems through the lens of a traditional left wing ideologue.  They see solutions as big government programs.  After 8 years of failure and corruption by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton people are simply fed up.  Hillary's assessment of Trump supporters as "deplorables" exemplifies the snotty, contemptuous attitude that corporate democrats have toward the little guy who struggles to put beans on the table.
Did he call any women fat pigs?  Did he mock a disabled reporter?  Did he brag about his marital affairs, and the size of his genitals?  Did he express his admiration for Vladimir Putin?  Did he ridicule John McCain for being a POW?  Did he say he wouldn't defend a NATO ally?   Did he attribute a reporter’s questions to her menstrual cycle?  Did he smear a Gold Star family?
Lynn,  I think you misinterpret my comments.  I believe it will take money to build permanent structures and set up mental health and physical health clinics to address this problem.  The money for the city hall is just sitting there.  It was never approved by the electorate and as a result it can be redirected to address our city's true needs which is to address homelessness.  And it should be done.  I personally don't think we need a new city hall, but if the city thinks it does, it should float a bond measure to support its funding.  This seems more proper than the current situation.  The city continues to ride on the edge of  what is appropriate about seeking the electorates' approval for things.  They know it won't be approved so they maneuver around and use loose interpretation of how money should be spent to do what they want.  For example, they just voted a $7 per month increase in stormwater fee so that they can do park maintenance--a bit of a hard connection for me.
Raw milk isn't bad.  The pathogens that now inhabit our environment are, and they're contaminating milk and meat.  It didn't used to be dangerous to eat moose and deer meat with the center still 'pink'.  Now it is.  A young woman did so in 2013 and her unborn baby nearly died and may still lose his sight:  https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/article/link-found-between-moose-meat-and-unborn-babys-infection/2013/10/11/  The baby was infected with the cat-vectored parasite Toxoplasma gondii.  It's the leading cause of infectious blindness.  It's also being transmitted from infected mothers through their breast milk.  It used to be safe for British Columbian mothers to eat beluga meat.  It isn't anymore:  http://news.ubc.ca/2014/02/13/bigthaw/  Women in Arctic Canada are delivering stillborn, deformed and blind babies after eating whale and seal-meat contaminated with T. gondii.  The pathogen also causes chronic miscarriage.
What the link to the list of very expensive illness doesn't show is how many of those people got better. How many died? How many are still sick with no cure in sight?
Let's clarify your comment further, Cooper.  All able body homeless should work, but many choose not to.  There's a lot of the homeless that don't have the mental or physical capacity to work; i.e. mentally ill or disabled.  Many are too old and wouldn't pass the smell test when it come to aging out of the job market.  So, where can they go besides the streets, Brother Francis, and Beans Cafe?
I like a faith acccessible to a scholarly genius as well as a cognitively disabled child. I like the realization that their faith is exactly the same, with one exception. Jesus told the child to come to him. He told the genius to go to the child. Merry Christmas.
How would you feel if the Lord blessed you with lung cancer someday (as a learning tool). And when you went for treatment or a cure all of the doctors told you "we have nothing to help you." Because all of the scientists were spending all of the research funds on trying to cure the GAY. You are amazing!
i don't know WHO you are accusing of 'flagging' you, but i didn't. as far as women no working- not contrary to Biblical law. Note Proverbs 31 in the OT, and Lydia (a buyer of purple cloth) in the NT. Not going in to the physical disc of sex and menstruation, but it has shown to cause chronic pelvic disease. And eating pork opened people up to many diseases.  I don't eat pork (mostly) or shellfish because they are garbage eaters. Christ as a Jew didn't have to say anything about homosexuality, because the OT did; and writings in the NT concur.
The divorced Southey cares about women's right and will march, but doesn't care about people of colour, people with disabilities and other human rights violations.  Typical Canadian WASP.
I miss that TV show where the 13-year old girl (actually a young looking adult woman) would invite adult men over to frolic in the hot tub. When they got to her place they'd find a TV crew waiting to ask them to explain themselves.
The blind will be led by the blind until they fall off the financial cliff.
I suggest everyone read "Some Considerations Concerning the Response to Legislativ Proposals on the Non-Discrimination of Homosexual Persons", if they want to understand what the Church really thinks of gay people. Particularly paragraph 12:  "Homosexual persons, as human persons, have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity (cf. no. 10). Among other rights, all persons have the right to work, to housing, etc. Nevertheless, these rights are not absolute. They can be legitimately limited for objectively disordered external conduct. This is sometimes not only licit but obligatory. This would obtain moreover not only in the case of culpable behavior but even in the case of actions of the physically or mentally ill. Thus it is accepted that the state may restrict the exercise of rights, for example, in the case of contagious or mentally ill persons, in order to protect the common good."
Sorry, by the way. I re read my post and it comes off as really sarcastic. it was only meant to be a slight bit sarcastic. hehehe  As i said to Jane, i think the farm thing could work as an addition, but what you are really proposing is what all of the industry has been trying to accomplish for the last few years. Its called Housing First.  The basic concept is the same, Identify someone that has "issues" and get them off the street immediately, into some stable living situation (an apartment), and then once they are off the street, address their medical needs, physical needs, mental needs, The laws need updated to be able to help someone that refuses and is an obvious danger to themselves. that is the "arresting" part that needs done, call it Implied Medical Consent maybe ? (they cant understand the condition and we assume they need medical help?) And we already have the database. Its called the HMIS system, every city and state funded agency uses it with Housing First
This a waste of our tax payer money right now and sorry to say is not the root of cancer dilemma here or america anymore. When I was a child there were ads on t.v with Joe camel and the Marlboro man. If you go back another twenty teachers were allowed to smoke in class. Smoking was the normal. Now there is no smoking  In schools and so forth dont smoke In cars with other people who dont smoke And so on. Smokers in general are much more few and far between then back then. Yet cancer rates and even diabetes rates have more than doubled? And they keep going up? Maybe look to the real culprits next time. Or even better spend that money on the real crisis in Alaska. Our prescription pill, Heroine and Meth population is going through the roof. Little known tid-bit for those who aren't In touch with society today. When you give someone presc. Pills and then take them off it later if they are addicted they will move right over to heroine. Thanks Doc! #WhyDontWeDoSomethingthatmatters!
... I see here has so many people easily dismiss the idea of being mentally unstable. it is a real thing and from someone who goes through it her actions and Facebook activity show to me that she is truly fighting a battle within her mind. Mental health is just as important as physical health and from my point of view I believe it is more important because if you are not mentally stable everything else crumbles beneath you. That includes your physical health your financial responsibilities your relationships suffer the environment that you are in deteriorates just to name a few things. People on this forum are making jokes that she is using her mental instability as a cop out. This simply is not true. If you know someone or you have been there, all of her actions make complete sense when you examine her frame of mind. Do not be so Hasty as to dismiss something that you have no understanding of. Doing so would be arrogant, ignorant and completely lacking in any sort of empathy
I was not my purpose to purport to diagnose Trump but to use the common words we all do to describe someone who is off. If one wants the shrink words of ( Trump's  latest biography) the DSM V, he appears to have a delusional disorder with grandiose delusions, a paranoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy) , and Narcisstic personality disorder ( Sara Palinitis -😀) . Added to that his bouts of late night hypomanic tweeting suggest a bipolar mood disorder but perhaps it is hyperthymia.  Another obvious explanation for all his bizarre behavior would be a medical condition like Pick's disease.  He should submit to a complete mental and physical evaluation if he wants to be taken seriously as a candidate after this last week. As much as I would like the positive effect on oil prices of his launching a nuclear strike, the pacifist in me thinks it unwise.
Exactly. Just like LBJ, blowing thru SSI funds with that "convoluted accounting system" to pay for Vietnam.  Still paying interest to China today.   "Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, "I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months", he shouted. "You'll be dead politically in six months"."  Were from the Government, and we will kill you, rob you, and rape your children.  In a hotline message from Moscow, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin said, "If you want war you're going to get war."
GBA:  Re: reparations:  I think the greatest reparations African Americans could receive is to be treated with respect by all of us.  To somehow live in an America which was truly "color blind."  You've seen the type of hateful, disgusting posts across the internet which targeted President Obama because he had the audacity to be a Black man elected President of the United States.  You state he was elected BECAUSE he is Black.  I would suggest he was elected despite being Black.  He's a very decent man, his wife is a very decent woman.  Do you really feel they deserved eight years of racist rants targeting them?  Do you really deny that millions of Americans still view Blacks through the prism of racism?  Do you really feel African Americans in our country don't have to work harder and be better than do whites to succeed in America?    Charles relates the resentment he feels from a lifetime of discrimination and you caviliarly
What are all these environmental and health issues that deep fracking like this have caused? Zero evidence of this. You probably believe vaccines cause autism too.
I wonder if the local news channel will keep a "Clinton Baby-o-meter" 9 months from now like they used to after fleet week during the Rose Festival...   I've seen him speak in person, he's a charming dude.  Watch out ladies!
Your all insane.. Do you not get it? The media is using this to disrupt the country from the real issues. They use this to divide us and make us weak, black vs. white or what about the fckin Indians.. Research world news right now, read the real stories! Our media is giving us a pacifier to suck on! This is not a fight of black, red or white OR rich or poor, this will be a fight to keep this nation alive. If you can't see that your blind and stupid because even a blind man can see in his heart.
His rating has drop to 0 as far as I am concerned. He's a greedy fool of a man, undeserving of his office.
If the state is going to have non-consensual sex with us, make it as painless as possible with a SIMPLE flat tax of XX % of income (even our mindless politicos can do that math), NO BREAKS, NO EXCEPTIONS EXCEPT VETERANS. 5% break for veterans, and NO tax for disabled VETERANS. NONE.  Did YOU do your duty or do you not care? So simple, but unlikely because politicians will not be able to worm their way out of paying.
As if a cardinal could "invalidate" a baptism...
I'm hopeful that there are no permanent psychological issues with the children.
You are partially correct, I used an imperfect example, Social Security  might  or might not pay, I know many folks who are refused by social security but they are non the less disabled and unable to work. Social Security if paid is not taxable, and in my opinion neither should a super low income person be taxed on their PFD income, but under the Walker plan more than 50% of the PFD that this imaginary disabled person receives is taken away, without any fuss or muss. If it was simply taxed as taxable income as I would propose then it would be at a far smaller percentage than 50% for somebody in this situation and probably not taxed at all. Those supplemental payments you mention are also reduced or eliminated under the walker plan, and many other plans being bandied about.
Right, so instead of proving your claim about the Hawaiian haters in this thread, you instead respond with the typical racist Hawaiian stereotypes about haoles.  I see racism in Hawaii because ignorant racists like you pretend that your blind hatred is something other than what it is.  The fact is I have said nothing different than the kanaka maoil who were arrested outside of the Na'i Aupuni convention, but the difference is, you can not stand hearing it from someone who you assume does not have the magic blood.  News flash. Every single person on this planet is indigenous. Get over yourself.
While I was not rooting for Romney to win against Obama, it would not have  been catastrophic. Romney is a decent, intelligent man who does not grope women or ridicule Muslims, immigrants, women or the disabled as Trump does.  Trump has the intelligence and reasoning skills of a 7 year old. having a temper tantrum. My apologies to all 7 year olds.
You have no argument so you resort to deflection.  Of course anthropogenic habitat destruction takes the greatest toll on wildlife.  But feral and at-liberty domestic cats destroy 2.6 billion birds each year in the US, more than all other human impact combined EXCEPT for habitat destruction.  Your argument is no more logical that arguing that those Texas klansmen who in 2011 dragged an elderly black man behind their pickup truck until his head was torn off are not as bad as the da'esh ("ISIS") because the latter behead more people; or that heart disease kills far more than cancer, so for God's sake lets not DO anything about cancer.  That is what passes for the "logic" of your argument.  Anything else you care to add?
I take the image the Church has given us, the Crucifix.  Rohr HATES talking about the Cross, because it upsets his snowflakes who want to think that love is emotion vs. a decision of the will, often a personal costly one.   He's no different than Joel Osteen
You don't throw out the value and dignity of human life expressed by the Pro life movement for the value and dignity of human life championed by the need for fair work and wages. Both are vital.  But if we don't recognize the value of life in the womb, the other, in its very essence loses meaning. Of course we must take care of the poor and homeless. But we need not neglect the sanctity of life to do so. We also need to fight against a system that encourages dependence on the government for living and thereby prevents the dignity that belongs to work. This in itself creates generational poverty. We could demand candidates that support both aspects of the sanctity of life - pro-life candidates from our progressive groups or pro living wage from our conservative groups. Alternatively, the Church ( and I do mean all who bear the Name of Christ) can stop expecting the government to do what Jesus told us to do - feed the poor , shelter the homeless, etc. and do it ourselves.
Not all of them but many of them are for agreeing with Trump about blacks, women, the disabled, etc., etc., etc.. Being American does not mean being conservative only.
A recent story was of the woman who became a cop, and hunted down her childhood abuser ... and I know of personal stories where children grew up and exacted ex-judicial (not necessarily violence) justice.  The LEO's turning a blind eye of course.  There is more justice in the world than there appears to be at times.
"Historical Fact ? Nonsense, you must have plunked down a 100k for a degree that taught you this and now you have to pay it off - Simple organisms still exist today. And the Bible didn't say God needed rest, it says he rested.  And you have not witnessed every organism that exists. You also have no answers for the origins of matter and energy or human consciousnesses. Sorry to burst your bubble, but the only proof of evolution is the evolving theory itself. You mention "fairy tales" like a frog becoming a prince or a rabbit coming out of a hat which is what evolution teaches? No thanks - I will stick with God - he has been tried and tested. You probably need to quit watching TV, I have no knowledge of Harry Potter. Keep following your crackpot 18th century scientist who had a list of mental and physical problems so long I can not even list them here.
The federal carbon tax, as well as any existing provincial carbon tax schemes, is foolish. It's like being robbed by a blind midget in a clown suit -- you just can't believe it's happening. With an economy teetering on the edge of recession, we cannot afford silly boondoggles like this. Canada is not even close to being a major contributor to climate change, so why pick our pockets now?
Your response, JoanK, is well-stated, depressing, and scary. Yet, I am afraid, if we are honest, the facts support your analysis. How can anyone credibly challenge your take on this?   Anyone want to try?   And the biggest irony to me is the Church's continuing citing of "natural law" in these matters when, as you say, denying--even mocking--the KNOWN intrinsic physical and psychological value of human sexuality reflects a defect in the understanding of human nature.   I can only ask why the expertise, experience, discernment,  and wisdom of the laity--and that includes women!--has been so demeaned and ignored. It seems this is one area of human existence where those who knew least are considered more credible than those who know most. Unless, of course, "sexual pleasure and comfort" are suspect and even wrong.   Again, I ask "why?" Thanks, Joan.
Trump's clear "intent" was to mock the bodily movements of a disabled man. It is irrelevant what the dispute between them may have been. I neither know their dispute, nor do I need to know it.  The relevance lies in the way that Trump conducted himself. In this instance, he conducted himself shamefully. If you genuinely believe that pointing out Trump's shameful behavior towards Kovaleski is "a base appeal to emotion", then good for you. "The wrong-doer knows no shame" - Zephaniah 3:5.
It is your quip points, tendency to use the pun without recognition of processes and politics that impact OHA that I am referencing  Yes. People are dying; spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically.  Remember that as to why social determinants of health is an equity issue and HAWAIIANS (not Hawaii residents) are dying earlier.  Social determinants of health has not been around as long as Housing First, yet Hawaii after 20 years of knowing about it and NIMBY backlash is implementing because homeless are all around us.   Implementation of social determinates to address said issues requires systems and departments  to collapse their bureaucratic walls.  Housing, education, etc.  Easier said than done for separate depts. to work together, and is where legislation may be helpful.    I'm glad you brought up my comment of blame, which is referencing me not blaming.  FYI:  Long ago HAWAIIANS did not blame.  Missionary-influenced.  No blame to the missionaries.
It is estimated that almost 90 percent of the US adult population has been exposed to herpes or carries herpes, so getting tested is basically a moot point. http://www.freeherpesdatingsite.com/
As a concerned former HPD Officer, I see the department crumbling from within.  There seems to be no pride nor concern for outstanding IMAGE in the eyes of the public.    I have witnessed an office serving as a special duty officer on Waialae Ave in Kaimuki without his uniform wearing shorts and a bulky vest with "POLICE" on the back of the bulky vest; a special duty officer sitting on his bag chair at the intersection of Woodlawn Drive and Alani Drive; an officer picking up his child at Stevenson Middle School in his black car with its blue light on...probably on duty at the time;  officers smoking while on duty in public; etc; etc; etc.  I guess the current mayor is either blind or not concerned with the negative image or the lack of pride exhibited by "his" police department and the obvious politically motivated inaction his is taking with Taketa.  It seem like most of the Commissioners are appointed because of a political favor or guarantee a large number of votes for the mayor.
Grant, you haven't been paying attention, Arya lost her sight before this season's opener.....
Most of the commenters in here have already said it better than I ever could.  May your daughter Rest In Peace. I wish the same peace for you and all who loved her. You are a remarkable woman.
The Vatican is still smarting mightily over the seminarian Joel Wright situation -- the sight-impaired man who achieved admission to the USA's lone pontifical seminary, directly under Vatican jurisdiction, from which he announced his plan to "adopt and abuse a baby girl."  Fortunately for the baby girls of the world, USA law enforcement moved a lot quicker than the seminary authorities, including this misbegotten document!  The Vatican Curia and its chieftains have once again missed the boat on providing safeguards for minors, and on understanding the basics of human sexuality.  Back to the drawing board?
Trump mocked the disabled reporter.  He also mocks other people using the "mentally disabled" theme.  He's a thoughtless rich boy who never grew up.  And if anyone cared for him, they would take away his twitter feed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hEQKqFgfAg
He failed to protect the students from ongoing physical/sexual abused by the bullies in this school for the disabled.  As a SW5, I expected more from this worker, and if he could not protect these students himself, then he should have made it known and demanded that the authorities take immediate action.  Now would have been the right time to blow the whistle.  Assuming here, that these are also mentally challenged children as well.   Being deaf and/or blind does not mean stupid, but all children need to be protected, especially in an "institution."  This worker is at best, the sacrificial lamb and he is being rewarded for his silence.  Is this the trend in State/County government..pay for silence?   If this was a parent who failed to protect her child from abuse in the home, she would be subjected to criminal charges.
Tompaine:  I really wish your statements were true.  Since all studies and surveys show that only five to ten percent of the homeless are "voluntarily" homeless, it would be the homeless population would, by definition, be reduced by ninety to ninety-five percent.    You mention "the relatively few who would work if they had resources to become employed and if THEY DIDN'T SUFFER FROM SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL CONDITION MAKING ANY PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION IMPOSSIBLE." (my caps, for emphasis).  That is precisely the point.   The bulk of the homeless population face significant barriers to working their way out of homelessness:  Mental illness, alcohol and substance abuse, Vets with PTSD, physically and mentally handicapped, women, often with children, escaping an abusive relationship, teenagers escaping physically and, often, sexually abusive homes. and other individual issues.    Your last sentence seems to imply they should be treated like lepers.  Am I misreading your statement?
Thank you, ladies for bringing up this issue.  Having credentialed teachers who live in this community will provide stability in teaching and learning.  Student success as you point out comes with a stable teaching environment.  A career ladder for those who are educational assistants is a way of "growing your own", and securing a better future for teachers and students.  Large state bureaucracies  are often "community blind" to assets and the available potential of community members.
Be real, if u only knew your sperm would love that chance....ovaries, plural. They have more then one...
Westboro Baptist Church members - they show nothing but arrogent disrespect for others, blind hatred, and ignorance only masks their own fear.  Jesus would weep.
It was my favorite class until Jacob, a boy with severe autism is obsessed with me to become his friend and won't leave me alone.
Very thoughtful comments and much appreciated Metooist.   Seems as I've aged I've gotten a bit more realistic.   I'm not at all sure that's a good thing, I was kind of comfortable in my idealism at one time.   One thing that hasn't changed during my life is the power of the MIC.  Ike was right.  The US can control our own behavior, but we have little chance of controlling the behavior of other nations being as the flow of knowledge world wide will lead to deadly assaults, how big is the only question.   If you want to sleep better, forget the use of the nuclear weapons and think about the more subtle release of deadly virus, or aerated poisen, water poisen........  It can make you nuts.    My father in law used to say, "When you number comes up its time to go".   Tough coal miner who died of cancer, but still left the world with amazing fortitude.      We are never in as much control as we'd like to believe.  Again, great comments.
Markham is completely out of control.  Corruptas hell.  We need to fire anyone with athority and oversight as they are NOT doing their jobs and turning a blind eye.  The CRA must be cleaned out starting at the top - the CRA is not only allowing tax evavasion but promoting it to the chinese.
Pius XII would be six popes back from Pope Francis if you count John Paul I.  I realize the magisterium doesn't teach creationism. Yet Catholic creationists exist.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_creationist_organisations#The_Kolbe_Center_for_the_study_of_Creation
What if a white guy is really drunk and stopped by a cop.  They get out of their car and wanders around hollering this and that, stumbling around.    Do cops immediately yell at a drunk white guy to get down on his knees with his hands up?  No, America's cops don't.  Here the cops treat a drunk white with respect and handcuff  them off to jail to sober up.  So what is the difference between being blind drunk or on PCP.  The color of one's skin.  See Tulsa video.  Get real America
It's not reasonable to call out divorce on its own (or blame women for initiating divorces.) Divorce, while considered an ACE, is not necessarily harmful to development. In fact, supportive parenting through a stressful time (like divorce) can promote resilience in children. Also, as motleycrew suggested, divorce can be an adaptive choice for people in abusive relationships. A point well taken from this article is that any one ACE doesn't mean that a child will have poor outcomes. When negative experiences begin to add up, however, is when poor mental and physical health outcomes arise.
I respect your forthrightness and agree but perhaps normality and I have disagreements on occasion.  Why not speak of dreams? Sort of strange publicity but I like strange. It seemed long so I'll be brief cause it was really strange. I was across a field from a man and we took notice, he was neither young or old... to make a long story short, after incident this person was very hard on someone that I had to make an apology too, a juvenile because he was chastised for something he was not to blame for (is very hard explaining dreams). This man was extraordinary but his nature was confused, he had only sight in one eye and showed me his blind eye openly as if making a statement. So what did I do in my dream haha? I tried to dance with him lol! Sooo me. The dream was much more complex and drawn out but it challenged an idea that has been stuck in my head. Dreams make no sense but this one, for some reason did. Perhaps a reflection of some kind, perhaps a crazy dream but you said please :)
Of course some women experience emotional and physical trauma, during and after abortions. I've never said otherwise. I was just noting that if this choice is presented as a ,matter of risk assessment, women run greater risk when they carry a pregnancy to term, and it is dishonest to suggest otherwise.   I am not willing to think of proven falsehoods as "information." Nor can I admire organizations that dress volunteers up in lab-coats, to dispense such "information"  as though it were substantiated fact. Also, I do not think that any tactic that keeps an abortion from occurring  is by definition morally sound. These views often bring me into conflict with anti-abortion advocates.   I'm told some theologians have regarded lying as the most grave of the capital sins, because of the violence lies do to the pre-eminent human project of seeking Truth. Lying is like crapping in the cistern from which we all drink. If one can't fight without falsehood, the fight may not be well conceived.
Per capita, there are more American Native vets, than from any other group.  I'm a vet, with service related disabilities that prevent me from ever getting a high paying job.  I had to start my own company, just to be able to hope to eventually make a living.  So cry me a river.
Confession, sincere and frequent, provides graces many REALLY need but are too clouded with pscychobabble to understand and seek.  Their intellect has become clouded.  They are walking effectively blind.   Too much cynicism (e.g., "I remember 25 years ago..." stories), negativity, grouchiness and urban myths surround this great Sacrament, fogging reality.  Note that the "Mercy door" still required Sacramental Confession be obtained, among the other "usual conditions".   The graces offered in this Sacrament are very gentle and helpful.  It's also innoculative, keeping us from furthering the distance between ourselves and Jesus Christ with lesser sins.   An amazing Sacrament if we put our faith and shoulder into it.
The Communist period left Poland's economy devastated. It will take decades to repair the damage, particularly in agriculture which is still dominated by tiny inefficient farms.  The UN has several programs for prenatal and postnatal care, and these operate in Poland as well as the rest of the world.  As a Catholic I cannot support abortion for "economic reasons" or "serious disabilities", so I will leave that for others.
Lynn: To me, the concept of "traveler" has nothing really to do with the place of origin.  It's a reference to individuals who choose to be "on the road" and to live off the largess and compassion of others rather than be self-supporting.  They are not the mentally-ill, the addicted, the alcoholics, the physically and mentally impaired, thePTSD veterans, the abused children, the women escaping an abusive relationship, the suddenly unemployed, and others whose"life conditions" have caused them to be homeless.    I avidly support our national community help those who really need the help.  I infer from your comments over the years that you do, in fact, "lump" those who have chosen that "on the road" lifestyle in with the homeless.  I feel that is a problem.  These "homeless by choice" individuals a) siphon off support others legitimately need and b) alienate much of the public, thereby discouraging potential supporters from helping those persons I call "legitimately homeless."
The Bernie-or-Busters are actually working to keep Citizens United as the law of the land. They are working to cut taxes on the rich. They are working to take health insurance away from families that have only recently received it. They are working for Big Coal and against the climate. They are doing the bidding of a candidate who has demeaned prisoners of war and the disabled, described Mexicans as rapists, referred to women as barnyard animals, called for banning Muslims from entering the country and cozied up to Russia’s authoritarian president. (h/t D. Leonhard).  The last time that liberals cast a "protest" vote (for Nadar) we ended up with Bush. How'd that work out for the liberal agenda?   The Bernie-or-Busters need to come into the real world.
Excellent comment. Well-written and I think sums up the GOP predicament nicely. Also, great summary of basically who Trump is.   I'd only add that I think he probably has a very serious personality disorder. He behaves like a sociopath.
The recent change that the 144,000 has not been sealed but is still open. (After all the number of those partaking has only been going up.) Organ Transplants not ever being the same as cannibalism and allowing tens of thousands of people today the added opportunity to live life. On and on we could go filling pages worth of examples that prove new light never happened.  The fact is that new light could more accurately be called blinking light. New light is usually the realization that the Governing Body was simply wrong to begin with.   If the bible is true Moses parted the Red Sea, manna fell from the sky, prophecies came true. Jesus walked on water, healed the sick, fed thousands, raised the dead and so much more.   But the Watchtower Society has an entire HISTORY of mistaken policies that have been and still are forced on all Witnesses at the very real threat of disfellowshipping and being shunned for non-compliance. And then claims of "new light" to cover over their many mistakes.
I would like to know how you figure it's a fact that he dropped the child off with a broken arm! I strongly despise this man but the broken arm was noticed hours after he dropped the children off. The child was found on the floor asleep about two hours after being placed in his crib for a nap and that's when the "bent" arm was noticed! I was the person that had arrived and determined that the arm was indeed broken and we had no proof that it was from the "child beating punk" and chalked it up to a caught arm in the crib slats on the side! You cannot be saying unfactual information about this turd if you have no proof so please refrain. We do not lie nor bend truth like this POS who's life lives on a foundation of lies. He is alone and is gonna spend his holidays without the company of his boys which he doesn't give 2  defecations about anyways! Any woman that sleeps with this man after knowing this information should reconsider morals and ethics.
You take it from this article that these are so called all mentally ill when actually  most of the problems were caused by liberalism ie people feeling sorry for those who won't help themselves, people from a lost generation, people with alcohol/ drug problems, and the list goes on. By the way many cancers were caused by how you were raised along with obesity, lazyness, poor manners, diabetes, and general poor health. Look back at the pictures of the people just after ww2 and see how healthy they were and without drugs. Sure there were people with problems but people didn't blame it on everyone else and families helped their own.
I agree with Xavier Malcolm that cell phones are only a part of the problem albeit perhaps an important part. There is not a single time I drive to even a destination close to my house where I do not see drivers engaged in driving that lacks the most basic common sense in terms of either safety or efficiency.  Oregon and likely the US in general does not place enough emphasis on driver education. It should be difficult to obtain a drivers license, something one only achieves if one has both the knowledge and the skills. People do not PAY ATTENTION to what they're doing, they are ignorant of the rules of the road or they simply have no driving skills/knowledge whatsoever. Many people drive as if they are the ONLY person on the road, call it autistic drivers syndrome. Sometimes I just look at other drivers who also witnessed yet another act of driving stupidity, put my finger to my head and pull the trigger. My horn is getting worn out.
The Deady Hall renaming drive teaches us something important.  Just a Oregonians were blind to the evils of traditional slavery 150 years ago, modern do-gooders are blind to current evils.  Today, 1 percent of the American population has been enslaved in the prisons.  Blacks and minorities are disproportionately represented.  A few are there because they pose a serious threat to others.  Most are there because Americans still don't get it when it comes to respecting fellow humans.  Those who expend energy on the dead Deady issue, apparently have no problem with the enslavement of so many, this time in cages where every action including excrement is monitored and controlled.  The blindness of the many to current atrocities and the focus on those past that no one can do anything about is so representative.  We still do not respect our fellows.  Start with current practice which can be changed.  The focus on the past is cowardly and empty.
NO they arent. The National Institutes of Health has an ongoing research project on obesity. You may be able to find some good information by sifting through this:  http://www.obesityresearch.nih.gov/  The World Health Organization also has some good info:  http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/  The Centers for Disease Control has actual statistics (the source for the MSN obesity map):  http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/
I hope you're not doing all the Cadwell defense on taxpayer time with taxpayer resources.
So if police officers must be in a strong  physical condition are you in favor of only hiring strong fit men who are over 6 feet tall to patrol our streets?  What about our military, do you think we should allow weaker females to be put on the front lines with our stronger males?  You can't have it both ways, but then again you profess the progressive agendas.  On another note if you can't drive the posted speed limit on a two lane road, causing traffic to back up,  you may want to turn in your drivers license. Drivers like that cause the same road hazards as speeders.
JamesReeves . 1. You cannot show one study that any substance, whatsoever, "is safe in any concentration for all of the public."  If you desire such absurd guarantees, you need to move to another planet..... as none exist on this one. . 2. Please provide valid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence of any "fluoride allergy", or adverse effect of optimal level fluoride on "infants, children, pregnant women, those with weak kidney problems, the elderly, etc."  It is the responsibility of no one to disprove the  unsubstantiated claims of antifluoridationists. . 3.  Fluoridation  is based on the most current, up-to-date science available.  This is precisely the reason why other fluoride proponents and I so easily dismantled the misinformation constantly put forth by you and all other unscrupulous antifluoridationists. . Antifluoridationists are the ones who rely on discredited 50 year old studies, and quotes from  such as the 1936 President of the Am. Medical Assoc. .  Steven D. Slott, DDS
Only children, disabled or mentally ill people should have other people manage their investments.  Everyone else, if you don't know what you're doing, simply open a low-fee self-service trading account with a bank or brokerage and follow Warren Buffet's advice:  dump all your money into a SP500 index fund with the lowest possible management fees.  Set your returns to reinvest (compound).  That's it, you're done.  Just keep piling money into that and when you're older, stop compounding and take the dividends out as income.
Sorry, but racism IS deplorable. Sexism IS deplorable. Xenophobia IS deplorable. Homophobia IS deplorable. Religionism IS deplorable.  Clinton was only 'wrong' in that she said "half" of his supporters shared T-rump's views when, in fact, polls at the time showed that fully 61% of his supporters shared his views.  THAT they do is what IS deplorable. It was FACTUAL, not a "hate inciting remark". It was/is the deplorables who proffer up actual hate inciting remarks.  And yes, the Trumpster DID mock the disabled. That he mocks others equally simply - and amply - demonstrates what a despicable example of a human being he is.
We definitely do.  As a world community, we have VERY far to go in providing care for disabled children.
See the one on the right, he's cross eyed, names Gladly. makes him Gladly the cross eyed bear.
Excellent! When we can recognize the "behaviors" of the hierarchy in another context and how demeaning those behaviors are we are able to look into blind spots. This isn't the specks and planks warned of by the Gospels. This is how we are able to identify "institutionalized" behaviors that are perpetuated across generations of leadership whether it is the hierarchy or a corporation.
The narcissist with psychological disorders was the President whose term ended on Friday, you may remember him among other things, as the man who delighted in the killing of the unborn, demanded under punishment of the federal government that a man calling himself a woman be welcomed into a girls locker room, used the Special Olympics as a punch line, and escalated tensions with a nuclear superpower after his candidate lost the Presidential Election...And I'm waiting for MSW, brave pro-life crusader that he is compliment President Trump for re-instituting the Mexico City policy.
Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits. 10 - 15 years ago they didn't have the technology we do today, they also didn't have all the little loopholes or questions or evidence that investigators have learned from experience that will arise when the investigation is concluded. Someone died, that person's family has been changed forever. Accidents are inconvenient for everyone, so are medical emergencies, illnesses, etc. These incidents can ruin people for the rest of their lives, reputations and determining correct responcibilty and just as important as to find out if there was anyway to prevent future accidents. Once evidence or a scene is compromised then there is no going back. If this was you driving, your loved one, or your company you would want to know that investigators and rescue personnel did everything in their power to determine what was best for all people involved. Accidents slow everyone down, but so do frivolous lawsuits and legal bs.
There was an interesting article in the Atlantic recently that exposed Mr. Simmons' and other HRC parrots who consistently accuse poor whites of being ignorant, racist, religious zealots who are mindlessly following Trump based on fear of "the other." The point of the Atlantic article is that many elite whites, especially those in  academia, are blind to their own deep seated hatred for the lower classes in America. Since they are boxed in by their own safe spaces of alleged racial tolerance, they have no problem whatsoever unleashing baseless vitriolic rants against poor and lower class whites. I call it safe hate. Essentially, this article is no different than Fox News code words like "thug". Far left ideologues are basically waging a Northern Strategy which routinely demonizes white lower and middle classes. The irony is that it is all being done to elect HRC so she can carry on with the incredibly racist foreign and domestic policies she has supported for decades. Utter hypocrisy.
I have seen crime documentaries regarding the issue of parents with physical, mental and  developmental disabilities and what they need to be good, safe, nurturing functional parents.  people adapt to the most amazing things but I do wonder about this lady.  to do what she did, she was most likely overwhelmed,.a fussy baby is a challenge under the best of circumstances.  I didn't get the first impression of her and drugs.  she looked confused to me I guess...
That is my reading, too.  There is more danger to people who have an out-patient colonoscopy than there is to a woman who has an abortion.  But, state legislatures are not trying to impose the same requirements on facilities and doctors who perform colonoscopies.    This type of restriction is absolutely pointed to making it more difficult for abortion facilities to even exist.  While I believe some restrictions, especially on late term abortions, are reasonable, I would rather we come to that from clarity about what we are accomplishing by limits - such as the 20 week limitation - than through the lies that so many legislators are using regarding their concern about the safety of facilities and doctors who perform the procedures.  When our legislators just blatantly lie about one thing we have no reason to believe they tell the truth on other things.  They attempt to manipulate through lying and have lost the right to claim the public trust.
I agree ... Canada is being sold off, with McKinsey at the helm.  Every decision made will benefit big corporations.  Citizens will be left holding an empty bag.
Should hospitals that don't offer emergency care, or mental health treatment or heart surgery then be required to forgo public funding also?  Not all hospitals offer all possible medical procedures.  Why should euthanasia be treated any differently than any other medical procedure?
a chaotic, loud prison?  predators everywhere?  oh yes...would you like to be in a prison population as quadriplegic?  someone comes in and just dumps you out of your chair in the shower.  if you're real "problematic"  - you're very well could be in that shower for awhile.  people who are psychologically ill, not just depression,  belong jn a hospital.  the best place for an unstable , helpless person  . a very secure hospital and they should do the equivalent time had they been in court.  none of the getting released in 3 years after murdering someone because you are "healed".  if you were to be sentenced for 15 years , it's fifteen years in the psych ward.
So you lied. Thanks for confirming that. Obama didn't award himself anything.
Right now I'm singing soul sister in my head lol!  That peace that comes with refusal to accept that this is it? You ever heard the famous Cheyanne quote? "Our nation is not dead until the hearts of our women are on the ground." A fraction, half or none at all.. your heart and spirit is calling for something higher and your willing to fight for it. Thank you for the inspiration..
Our society today:  "Something bad happened to me.  Whose fault is this?" No mention of the fact that a vaccine is available to all students at the U of O and undoubtedly from their primary care physician's office that would have prevented this.  But they don't get vaccinated because.....they are so busy.    Expect more of this as our new president has selected Robert Kennedy Jr.  to head a "vaccination safety committee."  RFK junior thinks that vaccines cause autism (long debunked) or maybe might cause you to bark and chase cars down the street.    Regardless, expect more children and young adults to fall ill and/or die as our national health care policy abandons science.
Well how do you explain all the marches around the world that included men and women black or white? Other countries don't vote in American elections, so what do you think is the message? Perhaps they do not want their countries taken over by hate, like this new narcissistic leader in the US is promoting: hate against the CIA, the FBI, the media-- the very source of democracy, women , the disabled and so on. Never again.
The woman who is pushing this, Shannon Basner, needs to have her head examined. As if we don't have enough problems with the local bear population, this woman wants to create feral cat colonies, or what would better be termed ...bear bait stations. That is just blind ignorance. Basner needs to take her T-N-R fantasy and go back to New York.
My great grandfather died of neglect a Riverpark in 2008.  He was t be released after rehab for a minor surgery. Apparently, his TED hose got bunched up around his ankle & not one CNA or nurse saw there was an ulcer; it got infected & he died at the facility. I called the Mortuary & they do not take or keep photo's of possible neglect.  I would think this would be law. My grandmother was at Riverpark in 2014 & was sent home with bad stage I & II pressure sores & UTI. Documented by my aunt it photo's, personal notes & PCP's telephone notes & the State Ombudsman & the State of Oregon Licensing & Regulatory Division said evidence is unacceptable. Dr's said grandmother as dying & put on Hospice. They were fired for failure to show a scheduled, failure to bring med supplies & refusal to provide written updated med list & written care plan. Not to mention 3x driving up on curb; suspected substance abuse? Family hired 2nd agency who overdosed my grandmother, refused to address weekly....
No, I didn't support Obama's program and I won't support Trump.  Sorry, but I don't believe angry white blue collar males will stoop to pick tomatoes or clean toilets in hotels and motels.  They won't suddenly line up to be caretakers of our disabled and elderly, and  I don't believe you think they will either.
God vs a man that is a self-described prophet? I have no issue with God striking the wicked dead. Why do you?
This is what Mitt Romney has to say about Trump:  I am far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament of be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter's questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity.  Think of Donald Trump's personal qualities, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics.  Now imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does. Will you welcome that?
And the problem with his hair somehow supersedes his opponents mental and cognizant issues how exactly, muckamuck?
How do you justify a long walk to someone on a walker that bogs down in 1" of snow when the city doesn't plow the sidewalks?    Walking a mile to a bus stop is fine if you're able-bodied, but not everyone is.  Finances are another consideration.  $2.50 for a day pass verses $7 for 2 rides on Anchor Rides.
I was addressing Fishing Fun's description of Trumpty Dumpty's comment as pleonistic. Trumpty, in his/her comment, referred to the American morbidly obese being made morbidly stupid from watching too much insipid reality TV.   Trumpty continued saying that anti-intellectualism runs rampant so that a half-wit becomes President of the United States. Those comments did not get bumped. But, mine did.
I'm a native and I can't wait for obummer to blow away that man has torn our country apart  it's really sad because that man was for corporate america we ain't blind the most horrible president ever!!! Corruption evil evil man!!!!
"Wrong!"  He DID lead the Birther movement.  He DID mock a disabled reporter.  He DID take out a full page ad calling for the wrongly convicted blacks in  NYC to be put to death.  He DID get caught discriminating against blacks in his rental buildings - TWICE!  He DID boast of grabbing women's genitalia.  He DID stiff several contractors.  He DID bankrupt a casino.  He DID lose nearly a billion dollars in one year.  He DID declare business bankruptcies - SIX times.  He DID encourage violence at his rallies.  He DID insult a Gold Star family.  He DID insult a genuine war hero.  He DID avoid paying Federal taxes for nearly two decades.  He DID cheat on all three of his wives.  His closest advisors DO  run alt-'right'/neo-nazi sites - and are quite proud of it.  He DID fill his Cabinet with the very same people who caused the problems back in W's time.  There is, of course, much more that he's done, so exactly which "lies" "the media" told about him remains a mystery.
What you’re overlooking is that the Islamic Republic of Iran didn’t have nuclear weapons then, and it doesn’t have them now. So Hillory the Blood Countess has repeatedly threatened to OBLITERATE–her word–a country in the event it launches nuclear weapons it doesn’t HAVE against a country that at last count has over 400 of them (including plutonium bombs), has never signed the nonproliferation treaty, has repeatedly engaged in nuclear blackmail against its neighbors, Russia and (indirectly) the United States, and which deliberately irradiated thousands, nearly an entire generation, of its own (Sephardic) citizens, who were children at the time–emphasis on were. Most of them are now dead, or dying of cancer.
If a dog is in its own yard and you shoot it, you need to be charged.  Since when can you just start firing off guns?  Mellerstig has mental problems.  He needs some jail and then some therapy.
"How about a 17%% tax on all prescription drugs with high addiction/death rates?"  Paid for by those on Medicare and Medicaid and Disability, right?
This selective apologetic presentation almost makes it seem that Moslems are better Adventists than us.  The statement that the Qur’an doesn’t negate belief in the Bible, the Trinity, and divinity of Jesus is contradicted by the following Qur’an passages:  9:29 – “Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.”  5:73 – “They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them.”  5:72 – “They do blaspheme who say:  ‘Allah is Christ the son of Mary.’”  It is obvious that those who believe in the Book [Bible], Trinity, and divinity of Christ are blasphemers to be fought and subdued.
No offence, but calling them "Bronze Age" prophets and referring to their prophecy as superstition is only labelling.  That isn't an argument.  Consider it this way - say, for the sake of argument, that you were someone who lived 2000 years ago, and saw everything that is written in the Bible about Jesus.  Say that you saw the blind made to see, cripples made to walk (and leap) and the dead raised.  There would be no question that you would have to believe.  Consider then, what evidence could you leave behind for those who had _not_ seen?  Certainly, this evidence is not _proof_ in the logical, mathematical sense, but it _is_ evidence.  Dismissing it is as impossible is a philosophical _choice_, made a priori, without proof.  I find it convincing.  I choose to believe.  That is no less reasonable or logical a choice than the alternative.
I always wondered what it would be like to see the writing of a complete fool willing to demonstrate pathological lying at its most vile.  You have succeeded beyond any psychological interpretation.  The daily tactics of the Tory/Republican/Fascist/Nazi/White Supremacist horde willing to use any artifice to destroy all human rights under the U.S. Constitutional Republic.  Disgusting.
All across Canada now, Muslims are creating isolationist enclaves to keep non Muslims out to protect  their  own culture. They are doing it  with  the permission of public officials using multiculturalism as the excuse  to create apartheid communities for themselves. Public housing for Muslims  only in Toronto prohibits handicapped, Asians,  single mothers, and gays.  In Edmonton they want to build an entire Muslim exclusive town  with provincial   legal  approval  but which would violate all human rights codes of Canada.   Bravo it all great and wonderful we are told. These ladies are the vanguard of creating what they see as 'their' Canada.
That would assume that both parties would adhere to that action.  Given the vagaries of a woman's menstrual cycle, so called Natural planning would be of little benefit to most women most of the time.  I guess that is what Pope Francis meant when he opined that Catholic families didn't need to breed like rabbits.   As for the woman I mentioned, her last two pregnancies were mostly spent in bed rest, one at home and the last in the hospital.   From your tone I take it that the woman is at fault.  Physically, it takes 4 years to replace  a woman's body what it takes to create a baby, not 4 months.  Obviously natural planning doesn't work for her nor is her ob/gyn at fault.  She has had two along with a surgeon who advised her to have no more babies for her own welfare.  Obviously her husband is no help and obviously he did not stick to the regimen counselled by our priest.  God would not want her to kill herself nor should the church or her husband.
Were the parents living in the same conditions? Maybe this is a case of poverty or mental illness on the parents part.
The numbers are being deliberately skewed by Planned Parenthood themselves:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?utm_term=.8f89ccc434db  And if I am ignorant or deliberately lying, God's grace covers even the most heinous sin. Thanks for your concern about my well being - it means a lot.   And how many girls who have sex at 10,12 and 13 are traumatized mentally, which leads to depression, anorexia etc etc etc. I should not even have to go into.
The onus remains on you to show how Seneff actually proves glyphosate causes the diseases you're claiming.  Provide a link with data on autism and glyphosate with the underlying causative factors and repeat that with diabetes and Alzheimer's too.  If you'd take the time to understand each disease, it's all caused by different factors and simply using correlation leading to causation is not only illogical and reaching.  Instead resisting learning, you'd do yourself a favor by talking to a statistician about Seneff's work and see what their stand is.  It doesn't take a scientist to understand why she's criticized.
I think individual families may be accepting and the Catholic ethos certainly supports respect for all people--in fact, mandates it. But the eastern European countries have a history of institutionalizing people with disabilities, a situation that has had a profound effect on the public's attitude toward them. Poland has begun to de-institutionalize but the support systems and the acceptance aren't really there yet. Poland has a very low rate of employment among disabled people and a spotty special education system.
You really haven't thought this thru have you?  In order to claim that you're a girl you'd have to live as a girl full time 24/7.  Makeup, hair, clothes, the whole bit.  No boys sports.  No hanging with the guys (that's assuming that your former "friends" would have anything to do with "the chick with a dick").  Of course you'd also have to live with the continual risk of assault (physical and/or sexual) by people that didn't approve of your very existence.  And that's not to mention that you just took yourself completely out of the hetero dating pool.  And all that for washroom access.
It's not pro-life, it's simply encouraging larger families, which is nuts, given the current economic situation.  The numbers of Polish people who have to work abroad to support their families is staggering.  And, now, thanks to the Brexit vote, many will have to leave the UK ..... But this bill talks about disabled children, specifically.  Disabled children need lifelong support, in many cases.  If these men want to encourage births of severely disabled children, they should give those children the support necessary, instead of the silly $1000 payment.  Perhaps, instead of encouraging larger families, they ought to focus on support for disabled children......
Ever hear of skinny-shaming? That's what I went thru. Sick or underfed? Call the authorities on my poor parents as I was wolfing down a dozen Sourdough Pancakes and venison chops smothered in wild mushroom gravy!  After giving birth, I walked out of the hospital in the same jeans I got pregnant out of! Oh, and at the doctor's, I was either viewed to be anemic, on illegal stimulants, or anorexic. It happens, Elise, and I feel your pain. There will be no Trump or Trump-like men in my life. Never was, never will. He sickens me.
So let all the disabled veterans and elderly that rely on the PFD suffer?!  You call them cockroaches?  You want them to scatter and run?  You sir need to re-evaluate your soul.  :(
She had sex with another boy or man who didn't have or wanted to use a condom.  So, because of that the unborn does not have a right to life?  Last I heard, there are many Alaskan couples who would love to adopt this special baby.
Its seems the mother Debra Brooks is in denial about what her son did to make money.  In all the discussion there has been no comment about where Brooks worked. It is not uncommon to see many mothers blind to what their children are. I have seen it happen in all races, I had a Aunt who once faked a heart attack to slow down the cops when they came looking for my piece of dirt cousin.
On the other hand, if you were a homosexual stoner with a pre-existing medical condition who works in the public sector - my guess is that Mr. Obama has been great.
And yet the ALCU does nothing & says nothing about a teacher in Hillsboro threatening to kill a student, or a teacher sitting at a special needs Blazer game making fun of special needs kids & complaining about having to serve special needs kids in her classroom, or a teacher, a dean of students, the school security gaurd & attendence secretary teaming up & namecalling "Diva and Prissy" & laughing as a LGBTQ Sped kid has the child has a panic attack. All from the same Hillsboro Or. High school. Go figure this society of advocates pick & choose who is disposable just as the school system chooses who they protect against Bully's.. No wonder the youth are having an issue. Their mentors are picking & choicing which of them are valueable & who is worthy of speaking up for. Everyone want our children to behave! Start enforcing our childrens teachers are suitable to be teaching our child social appropriateness. If they are fostering violent enviroments or hostile schools R kids  suffer & Mimic
You really need to google James O'Keefe and his antics at "gotcha" journalism that defies gravity. O'Keefe has been in trouble in court so many times for heavily editing his "movies" to twist his personal scripts and not to ferret out any truth and that is what he is paid to do. Trump hired Stephen Bannon as his Campaign Chief Executive who is a Brietbart News Executive and a former Goldman Sachs Banker who is known for his conservative right wing news stories that are more exploitation then news. So then O'Keefe appears on Trumps payroll. O'Keefe is not looking for the truth on his enemies, just some sound bytes taken out of context that fits O'Keefe's personal narratives that he gets paid well to create and when his targets get to the truth and get all of the tapes he did and prove that O'Keefe did heavy edits on his tapes, the damage has been done.
With three arrests so far, dropping charges is what's known as 'enabling'.   He can't be forced to have a mental evaluation unless there are charges.  He can't be forced into treatment unless there is an evaluation that he is a danger to himself or others.  By enabling him to  continue with what is now violent behavior, the family is ensuring he will get no treatment until it gets worse.  The 'family' needs to understand that the next person he is violent with may reasonably believe that he is  "Committing or attempting to commit a felony involving the use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person"  (like robbery).    That's when a citizen or a police officer is authorized to use deadly physical force.
Classy statement. You should be proud of yourself. The victim blaming, especially in this case, really brings it home for the win.   Should girls in short dresses, people of color, Alaska Natives, Jews, and the physically/mentally challenged keep a low profile too? What's your take on those groups? Just wondering.
Just curious, what are your feelings on the 4 who tortured that disabled man?
“Then you meet the person and find that she/he is really quite a decent, intelligent, compassionate and dedicated human being…” who has declared her intent–repeatedly–to immolate 70 million men, women and children with tactical nuclear weapons if “Israel” tells her to.  They almost certainly will; after all, they deliberately subjected 100,000 Sephardic JEWISH children to radiation poisoning in 1950 just to see what it would do–the ~94,000 who survived are dying from leukemia and cancer today.  Anyone who thinks the Israelis will refrain from precipitating a nuclear holocaust, or that Hillary will hesitate to enable them to do so for one second is deluding him/herself.
Another lamb led to the slaughter of intelligence, logic, and reality by a dictatorial structure of obedience without question.  If a tenet doesn't make sense or is just absolutely false, just have faith.  Obey the Pope as the infallible human gifted with divine power from the invisible entity.  Infallible edicts such as priest celibacy, no birth control, no premarital sex, sex only for procreation, no sex education or information, no end-of-life information or pain relief, no taxes on church enterprises, et. al.  Sadly, the waste of another human being whose basic intent is good, but doomed to failure from the crushing weight of church dogma.  Blind obedience is abhorrent to human nature.  Millenials who ignore history are doomed to repeat it in this feudal remnant of the Roman Empire.
This really says a lot about Trump's perspective when it comes to seniors, the poor, and the disabled.  When a President selects an ambassador he makes sure he selects one with great knowledge and talent in countries he considers important. But he selects his campaign supporters for countries where he just doesn't care. So if one gets a career, talented ambassador, one knows that that country is important.  Now, Ben Carson's selection says Trump just doesn't care to select someone with knowledge of the complicated life at HUD, in fact, to me, this signals that Trump will be doing what he can to pull a "Reagan", use tax cuts to the rich to impoverish the low income seniors and disabled people who depend on HUD housing.  So he has selected a woman to help destroy the Department of Public Education, and a black man to help destroy HUD.  Diversity. Time will tell if I am being too disrespectful and fearful.

Your entire premise is founded on outright greed. Lets assume that machines can make and repair machines and mankind loses all its jobs, what then? Does the one person that holds ownership manage the whole and watch the useless eaters starve because they aren't as cunning? I mean if they weren't smart enough to cut your throat before you cut theirs why let them live? That's what's being preached here.  Life has set requirements to sustain it and when somebody does not receive a living wage, they are subsidizing their employer by giving more than they are receiving (literally dying slowly). But hey, good for the nameless faceless corporation right, because after all our values are denominated in Federal Reserve notes these days. To the victor goes the prize...  Let alone the question of what less intelligent, mentally retarded, elderly, or disabled people etc... are supposed to do in this panacea.  At least Jack London learned the lesson.   Okay you found justice, now go find mercy too.
Ignorance is bliss. I was sexually molested by a Catholic priest some fifty six years ago by my local parish priest after serving Mass at the age of twelve. The year was 1961. There is not a day that goes by that the memories of being "touched" by that priest who you refer to as Father X haunt me. The damage that was done physically, emotionally, psychologically and spiritually never go away. I attempted suicide twice at the age of twelve after the abuse. Since then thoughts of suicide come and go like the seasons .I became separated from people since then because I trust nobody. I have received not one penny from the Catholic Church. Yet I still hold them responsible for covering up my abuse and the sexual abuse of thousands of others. They knew about what was going on and did nothing. They protected sexual predators and their reputation at the expense of innocent children. They should be ashamed. And you also should be ashamed for protecting them.
So you're saying no Russian athlete even bothered to register to use an asthma inhaler...just western athletes? Silly.
Did I place blame? Was simply a question. Depends on the boys maturity level, and level of special needs.  Just food for thought is all. If I had a son that was deaf and epileptic, I'd probably not want him out walking with a new dog by himself. Once we made the rounds, and the dog and boy had proven themselves, sure. But I'm not a parent, so what do I know. It's a cold world out there, as this driver has shown...
And Trumpy the Clown is equal parts Lester Maddox, "Gorgeous" George Wagner and Jimmy Swaggart.
Gaudium et Spes recognizes, as taught in another document of Vatican II, that is obligatory to rightly form a conscience, which for a Catholic particularly means particular attention to the Church’s teaching:  “Hence the more right conscience holds sway, the more persons and groups turn aside from blind choice and strive to be guided by the objective norms of morality. Conscience frequently errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity. The same cannot be said for a man who cares but little for truth and goodness, or for a conscience which by degrees grows practically sightless as a result of habitual sin.”  “But in their manner of acting, spouses should be aware that they cannot proceed arbitrarily, but must always be governed according to a conscience dutifully conformed to the divine law itself, and should be submissive toward the Church's teaching office, which authentically interprets that law in the light of the Gospel.”
Ms. Kendzior, I cannot believe my eyes, reading your column..... You dare to compare the ( after Trump ) USA with a central Asian dictatorship ? You must be a Hillary fan, blind and deaf for the REAL facts of life. Please understand the present situation. Hillary lost,The Donald won. Period. Lick your wounds and you will have another shot at it after four years. It is NOT the end of your world. It's called democracy at work.  Please keep on reminding yourself EVERY day how grateful you should be, that you are able to write your hate piece against your own country, without having the " security police " knocking at your door, arrest you and put you into a political re-educating work camp for LIFE! That would happen to you in Fidel's workers paradise and other dictatorships.  Put your mind in gear, before you sit down at your laptop and write your nonsense article.  Have a Nice Day!
Yeah, well my mom died young because of tobacco. Where'd we get that??
Actually, its not as simple as that. See, for example, XX male syndrome, Turner syndrome, Swyer syndrome, adrenal hyperplasia for just a few variations.
Do you think then, that the literally hundreds of video footage revealing that police brutality and racial profiling by 'some' of them has probably always been with us, is just a false revelation? I think it's a full frontal exposition of life in America.  I'm a vet, and I don't believe that gives me any priority to disregard the injustice that can occur...anywhere. My belief is that blind patriotism is just as dangerous to a nation as no patriotism all.   When changes in a culture need to happen, they don't happen all by themselves without individuals or groups expressing (demonstrating) that there is something wrong. Women in the late 19th century in the states and GB that were demonstration for the right to vote, were also sluffed off by a segment of society that said they were "just a bunch of do good-ers." Many of the women demonstrating were also brutalized by authorities. Of course it wasn't captured on video but people did observe it.
Why I remember it like it was yesterday ....... the Arab Spring started in Tunisia.  Obama and Hillary were on board and so were all of the Liberal media sources.  It was going to be a glorious time in the Middle East.  Unless you had a brain and knew what was coming like lots of people did.  It is now the reality of the Muslim Winter.  A place where the Obama's of the world have turned a blind eye to.  The Liberal media are unsure of what to say or do any more.  Even they may have finally come down to the understanding that there is no good guys and bad guys.  They are all BAD GUYS on every side and the only way to win in the Middle East is to be the Worst Guy.  Maybe we have learned a lesson to keep our noses out of other countries issues.  I doubt it though because our Liberal government seems to have to learn things the hard way.
im not sure you can do much on oahu but kauai is small enough to regulate i think. stop mega hotels, stop busses, use electric scooters to get around. every day that the registered owner, and it must be a person, not an llc, trust, blind, llp, corp c, corp or any other dodge, couldn't prove they were were actually living in their house, mansion or retreat or estate, a 1% tax per day is levied on the assessed value. you could waive it for people earning less than a living wage for kauai and renters. you might also charge $500/day tax for tourists. lots of rich asians would just love to not have to rub elbows with poor people from alabama or oregon. stop believing the lies the rich feed you about growth. people on the bottom dont benefit from it.
Levin is writing from a libertarian/individualist perspective and is blind to the existence of other world views.  Many economists also share this blindnerss.  He sees the egalitarian movements of the sixties and seventies-as well as the hierarchist/authoritarian movements on the right (such as the Moral Majority and the pro-life movement) as actions of individuals.  They are much more than that.  The civil rights movement still lives in the SCLC and Black Lives Matter.  Occupy is a quntessential egalitarian movement as is the gay rights movement.  He is blind to the nature of collective action, however, so he misses a lot.
You mean like your Republican majority blind mice in our state capital, Kearon?
there goes the ambulance chaser, they will be many more and he will make more money.  he is no crusader, all he cares about is making money for  himself.  he wants people sickened by tainted food.  this guy is a hypocrite.
as you know, being whatever sex you are, in that "male" or "female" persona....the opposite sex IS different...physically, of course, but psychologically too.  I have not heard many men sit down and say "i am just gonna sit down and have a good cry...doesn't matter what you say or do, i'm just gonna cause I wanna.  it'll make me feel better"  the last sentence probably heard from mom..."make you feel better." +++  it's not crazy, or whiny, or hysterical.  i'm not grieving or sad....it's just emotion.   I have laughed so hard as to set off a little crying riff, chuckling also then. a few female friends & I have laughed about it -  it's probably hormone driven and bet happens now to jenner  - gets teary eyes sometimes... before treatment he wouldn't have. ultimately, being a woman is not solely defined by being a mom...having children, breast feeding, pregnancy.  all the traits one admires in another, and the style of exhibiting them probably define male and female as well as body parts.
There is no connection to cannabis and Autism, however there are now thousands of man made chemicals throughout the environment (roundup for instance) that are far more likely to cause birth defects.  Cannabis if you care to actually look at the facts is the safest substance known to mankind.  There has never been an overdose death from cannabis in the entire history of humankind.  Cannabis is FAR safer than Alcohol, Prescription Drugs, Tobacco, and probably half the food in the grocery store.   Seriously learn the facts.
Though, the level of unfairness and humiliation that the Germans felt at the time -- Versailles Treaty, with all its consequences, was in fact unbearable -- has no comparison in the US. What harm did Mexico, the whole Islam or Women did to Mr. Trump followers to justify the blind populist enthusiasm? In fact, he sounds more like a Latin-American dictator than a European one, even af the worst times of Europe's modern history.
When a black citizen is killed by the cops race is an issue. Since race is not mentioned here we can assume the killer was black and the victims were all white, Asian, or Latino.
More likely it was a power struggle within the movement. "White supremacists" and cops might not have liked him but he was no threat.
Worth re-posting as Angelo has so succinctly described the irrational fervor that surrounds this activism.   I've drawn parallels between these extremists and the religious zealotry during DaVinci's time in so much that questioning the church or even being seen as engaging in any activity that questioned the Catholic church resulted in a heretic brand.  Today, the church is global warming.  Fascinating that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  angelo_vancouver  Climate change activism has become a proxy for loathing of the petroleum industry by the environmental movement. The issue has evolved into a belief system with apocalyptic hysteria, blind zealotry and religious notions of exclusion and condemnation of the non-believer. It's somewhat akin to an inquisition.   That being the case, all right thinking Canadians must fight back against this extremism. The best way to do that is to cast your ballot AGAINST this government in the next election.
I didn't state or insinuate what you claim. There are people in need because of physical and mental disabilities and limitations. Then there are those physically and mentally able who are too lazy to get off their cellulite laden ass to support themselves  and and their "families' with legitimate endeavors. What is mine is not yours.  I choose to whom or what I give or share.
The homeless are a "composite" of individuals with a variety of issues which contributed to their condition....and, yes, a significant number do deal with substance abuse. "Substance Abuse and Homelessness – National - National Coalition ... www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets... National Coalition for the Homeless  "Although obtaining an accurate, recent count is difficult, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2003) estimates, 38% of homeless people were dependent on alcohol and 26% abused other drugs." and "According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 20 to 25% of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some form of severe mental illness. In comparison, only 6% of Americans are severely mentally ill (National Institute of Mental Health, 2009)."  Of course these groups are not mutually exclusive, but both represent a significant part of the homeless population.   BTW: This has nothing to "off the hook" (cont.)
I moved to Portland from another state.  I can say it has been a "hell" experience.  Dealing with the unfriendly passive aggressive Portlanders has been a terrible experience! The job market started crashing. The rent increased as people lost their jobs.  I was desperate and moved in with my abusive ex to share expenses.  There has been no free speech or rights of any kind in Portland.  If this stuff is politically correct, I don't want anymore!  I was forced to share rent and got injured so badly that I couldn't work, and was advised to file for physically disability.  No one will rent to the physically disabled. Yes, I have filed complaints. Not one agency in Portland will help me.
Please tell me where the proofs are for any metaphysics engaged in by the Church?  You know actual physical proof we can measure and have it be repeatable.
If there's one thing the US Army needs, it's more heavily tattooed, overweight, stoned, LGBTQIABCDEFG recruits.  Our enemies will be laughing so hard that we can just walk right over them.
Wish I could "like" your comment 100 times Mr. Roddy. Cowards take from the seniors and disabled vets who don't have a big enough voice to protect themselves.
