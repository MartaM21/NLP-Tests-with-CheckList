“God gave us a choice. My choice is to love”- most ICONIC quote of 2020!
you are amazing !!!! I too loved dolls when I was young but now ................ Nah I want to become an astronaut
All Life s matter
They will say anything to win I say all lives matter and am black
@Blake Eloise why can someone not agree with something? She is not hurting anyone with her opinion as long as she is not harassing people.
If you're certain of what you want to study just do it! When i was a kid I thought I would be a superhero
I think that being a woman has less to do with being interested and capable of being anything traditionally where men excel at. I think personality type differences are a bigger factor in determining that. Institutionalized and gender barriers aside
Everyone be talkin about Annie but nobody's talking about the little girl. Like she was so incredibly mature and respectful. She was even asking questions herself which is so cool.
I am a smart beautiful engineer!
@Quordell Scott I was agreeing with all lives matter
The walls came down in this interview.
All lives matter!  Period!!   ALL LIVES!!
There you go. Well said. All this self stigma
India produces a lot of GREAT female engineers... they like to work!!  A lot of white women don't!
playing with barbies and choosing engineering  is totally fine girls!  electrical engineering came naturally to me i wasn't even worried about being less qualified than guys ! in fact my high school teacher encouraged me to go for it and yes he's a man + I come from a muslim third world country and nobody really cared if I was studying engineering or business or art
I’m so glad I’m in the Uk where in year 11 we have our GCSEs and since 2004 girls have outperformed boys in all subjects
Im only 11 but I LOVE science and math I want to be a trauma surgeon specializing in nuero surgery. I defintitely think that this will impower young girls like me or younger.
@zethon​ So asking people about there locality is now considered racist? LMFAO nnI am an Hindu Indian-American​ working in IT. I've never met any white guy asking me this
Actually all lives matter
Madonna has always been a philanthropist for the LGBT community.
Black lives matter is not discrediting other races it is just saying that we as black people are mistreated by society so they are saying we mean something we MATTER
We said All Lives Matter.nWe never said black lives didn't matter.nWe know that black lives matter.nWe know that racism is evil.nWe're just asking that you realize seperating yourself is in itself racism
She comes across in this interview as relatable and human. Beautiful and creative. Thank you Madonna for sharing yourself with us. Xx
If you want to walk into a room and do not look like an engineer you have to prove it what does that have to do with being a woman? If I walked in and claimed to be a surgeon no one would believe me either. Most things have nothing to do with sexism...nnMany things would not have been possible without female engineers? Why are we ok with that statement
All lives matter includes black lives
@V A jesus loves all .im Cherokee and i have black too
why is there no footage of the riots and the violence from the protesters? dont act like there an innocent group quietly protesting. wheres the footage of the protesters beating peoples windows out with objects when there just trying to get to work. wheres the footage of people standing in the middle of highways and roads blocking traffic of people just trying to get somewhere. wheres the footage of people looting and setting fire to businesses people worked there whole life for? and you all say you just want justice? smh you all just want a reason for the things you do so in your head you can think its ok. admist a deadly virus as well where we were told social distancing is key no lets just get massed together to scream loot and vandalize. i dont see one aspect that these people are helping in the world.
ALL LIVES MATTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! you pansies need to get your racist minds clear
@c a t l i n t good luck to you if you ever come out I came out to my Catholic parents and they are being really loving there's even a LGBTQ+ support club at my church to help closeted Catholics
its not common for women to work as blue-collar job in construction or plumbing.. Most of 'em are in the professional .
Women need to keep fighting
“God gave us a choice my choice is too love” that child won my heart
all lives matter. if you say someones life does not matter then yours does not.
Thanks for being there when no one else  was!!!
So great! Made me cry at the end
The Queen! Never forget wat she did for the LGBTQ community!
it should be because we're allowed to have on religion but not act on it if what were doing is illegal i. this case harming someone's physically
I love you Madonna. You changed my life.
shes emotional all thruout this interview - what a tough cookie and a great role model
i’m actually about to start my college on civil engineering! do your thing
She's intelligent and beautiful. This is really inspiring. I want to be a chemical engineer!
Who inspires you to come out can be very personal. For me
The Queen! Never forget wat she did for the LGBTQ community!
This is an example of an engineer that's picking and choosing data that fits her point. It's both biological and cultural.nnYou see
I've always loved trying to make stuff with Lego and when my friends doodled flowers and hearts I always sketched little 3d shapes and designs. Debbie sterling is such an inspiring and amazing person.
I am just a high school student dreaming to be a Chemical engineer in the future. And this helps me a lot.
Our God is about loving others. Conversion therapy and that sort of abuse does NOT fall in line with what he teaches us. It appalls me that some people call themselves Christians and think that's okay.
conversion therapy is torture.
I am studying biomedical engineering and 70% of my colleagues are girls
I just wanted to say to Christians (I am also one)nGod never said to hate anyone he said to love your “neighbors” no matter what.nJust wanted to mention it
Every life matters we all have a beating heart and have blood running inside us
What about all lives matter?
It happens in my country. Scum politician using rasism as a means to get power back once they lost it in elections. It works. People are like sheep. Especially people that sit on thier asses all day
People always assume I'm not technical. I don't assume anyone is technical unless I know them...? So? And why would someone being happy that you're en engineer be negative? The stats show that 12% of engineers in the US are women. So they are being supportive
“God gave us a choice. My choice is to love.” IM CRYING!!!!! I love that kid
It's more politically appropriate to say HUMAN LIVES MATTER!!!
+Kiiro Sagi (Verified) Why? we are just having a discussion. If I sound aggresive I apologize.
What an incredible man to be able to talk about such a traumatic experience. And these kids
Even Israelis here don't think that Trump's stargate is racist....
Black lives always matter. All lives matter. Together with all people we prevent chaos as  we stand for ALL rights for ALL people
Danielle D It didn’t because conversion therapy doesn’t fix anything. It just changes you to something you weren’t or makes you suppress yourself. It’s just harmful.
“God gave me a choice and my choice is love” that’s deep and amazing and i love that
ALL lives matter. We should not be divided by race or social distancing. Together we are united & please dont let this divide us. If the kids are united they might have a future. Let's stick together & ignore skin colour. I'm a pale ginger & I'm proud of just being me
In India women engineer is very common like 35+%. I did computer engineering and topper of my class is a girl.nMy interest is mechanical engineering but I chose computer because it has more money and opportunity but I don't love coding. So choose carefully whether it's computer engg. Or mechanical engineering.
Conversion therapy is literally just forcing someone back into the closet
I’m a female engineer at my university and there are four women including myself in my graduating class this was so awesome i almost cried I had the same set backs
All lives matter means all lives black brown white.   Are people that ignorant
This is very inspiring!!! I am enrolling for Civil & Environmental Engineering now.
I am saying all lives matter and I say law matter s and we need our cops and fire and we need to support our law and mostly our cops I hope our government or governors start supporting our cops let them do their job and I think they need a raise I think we need to stop charging them with  dum stuff yes some need to go to jail the one who choked that guy yes but the one with a stun gun no he just doing his job give him a raise good cop
@ozzie pants​ This idiot just called you sexist for wanting more women in a field where they're 10% and not men who make 90% (laughing my ass off)and a field they obviously can be in only if given some more encouragement but thinks he isn't sexist when he uses biologyas for why women don't get into STEM
@Hai Huynh I'm not buying it. There's several opportunities for everybody of every race and every color in this country to move forward. Systemic racism doesn't exist it's all a mentality. All lives matter all lives matter not just black
This is absolutely inspiring. I am glad that I chose to pursue Engineering. My passion for Math and Science has always been with me and now I can use my passion and forte to becoming a potential trailblazer
She saved my life too.
i BeLievE iT’s thEiR cHoiCe
It’s very important to teach these kids about this. I’m fortunate that I didn’t have to go through this when I came out a year ago. I’m 16 and I’m happy that my family loves and accepts me
All Lives matter. Jesus says it's not color.
Of corse all lives matter but thats not the fight right now. The fight is for black lives right now. People who say racism is gone are either blind or stupid. My best friend Joey and I go to conventions all across the east coast to film
WOW!!!!!!!That was so so inspiring and incredible!!! THis speech has just saved my day
God gave us a choice
She’s always be on our side even the days when homophobia was rife!
All lives matter and everyone must be treated equal
God does not hate gaysnHe does not hate anyonenThat’s kind of his thingnTrust me.... I’m a bisexual
That one young woman is not necessarily in the closet. I know many of the viewers on this are quite young and judgemental in a sense. I was also raised in a household with strong beliefs. I think it’s very incredible that she expressed hers and came on this show. It also shows that her parents are willing to accept her no matter what. She’s an absolutely beautiful and such an intelligent girl and I truly hope she reads more positive comments. Many of the people commenting are very young
@Shar R. i think that she's who she is and people can't decide her sexuality for her
I’ll never understand when someone says they “don’t agree” with homosexuality. It literally has NOTHING to do with you. There’s nothing to “agree” with. It just is what it is and always has been.
Sheis the greatest. This is why I will always love her. No matter what!!
We are all human beings! We live
My friend is a lesbian (idk if it’s true cause she’s young ish and says she said she hasn’t had a crush on a girl but she lesbian
Black Lives Matter.  All lives matter.  God created us all.
@Max Meyer Do you know that how intelligent you are depends more on your mother than your father?. Asap science had a video on that.
loves the person and hates the sin.
Or the police and justice system could just treat everyone equally
Every life Matters
The things that she has done are magnificent.She has personally flewn to Mexico to buy her friend some medicine for AIDS.This is not your everyday type of woman.Shes so intelligent too.I don’t think she’s appreciated enough.
@J Brown because the way it's being displayed is telling us that only black lives matter. They are trying to make it about themselves and hate it when anybody else even exists. All lives matter
@_Echo _ How do you disagree with being LGBT? LGBT people exist
She has saved my life as well beautiful person absolutely love you Madonna!
Wow I'm 16 and I'm inspired by her
It’s TRUE that all lives matter
All life matter. Many white communities in the rural area are poorer that black live in the city. No one have privilege in America except for the ruling classes. All the politicians in Washington DC are millionais or billionaire. We should remove career politicians from our system. I am a Asian don't have black or white privilege. But we can contribute and build this great nation.
My thoughts are if women want to do engineering they should go in it. And they should know that nobody is stopping them. That's important. Don't teach girls there's some patriarchy oppressing them
I tell myself always. Never give up girl child!!! You fit in
Science says that any differences between women and men are created by society
@TheLegend27 Is Alive  - But doesn't the bible also say to love everyone. The Bible might say it
women engineers are as competent and in fact
Great Message Madge! Where there's life there's hope!
It is not that girls lack competence in STEM
Not everyone want's to go into engineering. It's not for everyone and shouldn't be. We also need doctors
In heaven we all will be same no hate but love new body. It's time to move on and forget  slavery yes it was wrong but it's no more.  that generation is gone dead can't blame everyone for others mistakes what they did back then I wouldn't do and also not everyone did that kinda thing to ppl forgive forget move on its only way peace can be established. Today we need to be together  which needs to be all lives matter and we need to fight the wickedness in higher places the dems
i will never come out as bi to my grandparents because they are very proper and against LGBTQIA+. I came out to my dad and my sister. Im afraid that if i come out to them they will force me to go to conversion therapy
What the hell are u guys doing all around the world?! Attack innocent police stations that dont take duty to kill black people?! And then riot in the nights where we all cant sleep for the love of Heavens!
Not all black lives matter groups are this unreasonable. I've marched with BLM activists who stated clearly that they believed most cops are good people. I'm starting to realize that it's kind of pointless though.
Man I feel like I fit in now cause my mech class has 6 girls in total and this amuses me I can't wait to get into stanford
@Molly Rebekah I'm confused how you dont agree with someone's existence or choice to love. I'm not saying I hate you or this is hate
She taught me how to be bold and unapologetic...thanks Madge
All lives matter black white brown
Because all matter life everyone has same maker God he knows what going happen and we can all lives together just get rid trouble maker and all haters
Well she was fighting for us in the mainstream media when no one was
i first came out to myself when i was thirteen. that hit me so hard.
Fantastic job and great speech! I loved playing with my brother's lego when I was a child because my parents kept giving me dolls and I found playing with dolls so boring... Creativity should not be determined by gender stereotypes
All lives matter stop keeping racism alive
Conversion therapy should be illegal! It is totally a violation of people’s rights and it is physical and mental abuse!
stop forcing people to forcefully study engineeringnengineering is made for humans nif a girls want to study engineering she willnif she wants to study something other than engineering she willnIts totally her choice.nnnnnA person should only study something in which he/she is interested in and thus can excel in that field only.
As a Christian I want to hug him and apologize for what happened
Amazing Worenwu I’m sorry but your stupid and misinformed. All of us want black people living in our society BUT black lives matter themselves want to segregate the white and black people once again and it’s to “stop racism”...
I am hispanic and i say all lives matter because yes black lives matter but so do hispanic people we also matter i matter and so does my daughter she matters also
I NEEDED YOU I WONT GIVE UP . ITS ALL GOOD WILL BE OK
@Ashley Laurencya The only truth here is that conversion therapy does not work in ANY country (I'm not American either). Sorry to disappoint you. Sexual identity and preferences are rooted deep into our genetics
@jazzfan1 Fox (Right) & CNN (Left) are two different sides of the same coin. And if we just start throwing insults we've already lost the battle cause no one will listen to each other. Yes
Of course all life matters
All Lives Matter shouldn’t be booed. I feel like All Lives Matter should be positively viewed especially since it could help remind depressed people that they matter
GOD put all of us here... this is a test to see who’s going to HEAVEN... AND WHOS NOT!   Don’t be in the WHOS NOT cat a gory
I think sexuality is a choicennAh yes
this made me feel happy to know i’m not alone in the world. this gives me the courage to come out to my parents
This helped me a lot. I am in my 3rd year studying electrical engineering and I must say that I have never being motivated to push forward
All lives matter.  It's not healthy to divide and conquer on racial lines.  That's why I am worried about the black lives matter movement.nI stand for every child - no matter what the colour.  And we are ALL targeted by the police in one way or another.  Homeless people are profiled more than any other group.  And of course there is a disproportionate number of black people being arrested.  That has to change.  But the statement
Amazing talk! As a female engineer I know exactly what you mean and I've struggled throughout that process as well!
I stopped watching when I saw Sandra Bland's name given as if she was killed by racism. She committed suicide after being detained for a day for acting like a hysterical crazy person. The police do the same to anyone. Freak out on a cop and you'll spend a night in a jail cell to cool down. Turned out she was crazy enough to kill herself as soon as she could.nnStop black supremacy. Stop hating white people. The US government should treat all citizens the same regardless of race. We don't need a racial apartheid state or caste system or second-class citizens. No race is subhuman. Criminals
What a great inspiration! Loved it!!
I am more confident than before after listening to your journey. I am so lucky
I am a Catholic and the thought of conversion therapy on anybody disgusts me. I know that the Jesus I serve is NOT the same one that this person unfortunately had to experience. God is love and the way he was treated was NOT love so NOT God. I like what that little boy said. God is love and I chose to love. --Paige Kohlman nnnAmen
Human Lives Matter.
This is so inspiring Debbie. I am a web full stack developer
@Logan Schmidt I don't base my opinions on Fox news or any other news outlet. I have my own beliefs and opinions. I stand by my original statement. All Lives Matter!
ALL LIVES MATTER NO MATTER WHAT!!!! NO MATTER COLOR WE ARE ALL THE HUMAN RACE PEOPLE!!! GROW UP AS A HUMAN RACE OPEN YOUR MINDS STOP BEING SO IGNORANT!! THIS WORLD MAKES ME SICK THE WAY PEOPLE ACT NOW. WE ALL MATTER !!!!! #ALLLIVESMATTER #HUMANRACEMATTERS #NOSEPERATIONS
I hid my sexuality for 2 years cause I was scared then I came out and I’m happy I did
Danielle D Literally the most Christian girl I know is ace and panromantic. You can be Christian and fine with the LGBTQ+ community
@Attila Kovács They'll never understand. Keep getting brainwashed 🤦‍
As we live all under the same sun... ALL lives matter. Period.nIt never was about skin colour.nIt always was about anarchy in ypur neighborhood.
God gave us a choice
God gave us a choice and my choice is to love
ALL LIVES MATTER.  THAT'S IT . ALL LIVES MATTER.
Black Lives Don't Matter any more than Hispanics or Asians or Europeans or Africans or Arabs. Individuals are  responsible for their own words and behavior. There is one race called the human race. So stop race baiting for political agendas!
I can't thank you enough Debbie for this talknI had the luck of being able to play with not just girl toys
Bob the Buster Pride is celebrated because we are loving who we want. Also
The gays are so wonderful.
Proof that conversion therapy is useless and trashy.
Homosexuality isn't a sin and you can't change him.
priti patel mp the most disgusting human being. She should resign imediatly after her racist comment.
omg!! that's amazing. Hopefully you succeeded on becoming a video game develop.
They should not be saying black lives matter they should be saying all lives matter
thanks to her for her eternal inspiration
I think its really cool they were able to talk about such a heavy topic with kids in a way they get without completely sheltering them
@Complete repair lotion Smith cuz it happens alot i know a lot of people including myself who grew up in the church believing homosexuality was a sin but not feeling quite right about whivh she exhibited. I actaully got asked alot if i was guy when i was younger but i was so in denial. Now thst im older i realized im gsy and there nothing wrong with it. And that the vibe alot of people are pulling feom this girl
All lives matter - John 3
A freedom fighter who has saved a countless number of lives including an entire generation in Malawi
God gave us a choice. My choice is to love. I'm crying
+RandomHelpingGuy The same could be said for women in engineering but there was national will to overcome that.  I expect the same national will to overcome the prejudice you are talking about.
This world needs love
OK the title black lives matter is like an analogy or maybe  a metaphorrnwhen black individuals are being killed for no reason except for the color of their skin its almost as if their lives ' . people who are pressed about it not saying all lives matter are too focused on the title of the movement instead of what it's  for. and i don't think this movement is racist because it would be saying only black lives matter...ni hope other minorities with gain the traction to fight injustices they are facing as well #blm
Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It’s not only due to her provocative nature. I was waiting for Madonna to say that she is sexually fluid and/or bisexual when asked why she is such an advocate for the LGBT community. I’m not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.
PJ Davis (Spiritual Warfare Music) yes all of us are equal in our ways doesn’t mean we have to look all the same it will a disaster if everyone looks the same
@V A Jesus died for all.Jesus shed His blood for all.Blood washes away all our sins
it's not okay to guess someone's sexuality based on how they want to dress.
All LIFE  Matters. Even tomato plants.
Women can do anything they put their mind to! It takes studying and surrounding yourself around influential people!
Thanks and same to you...My best wishes to you Sis...Take care and Study hard...Dont worry
i came out as bisexual yesterday and now all my girl friends don’t wanna talk to be cuz they’re afraid that i‘m falling in love w them
The boy he wanted some tips so he can be there for his friend how sweet
I’m Christian but I’m also an ally! I chose love too! Conversion therapy is emotional and physical ABUSE!
PREACH! I LOVE GOD AND I LOVE GAYS! AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY!
All life's matter
All lives matter is basically supporting black lives matter if you think about it .
EVERY LIFE MATTERS. NO race should die from police brutality.
God gave us a choice
We're in scarrrry times & potentially looking ahead at a possible 4 more years of the same if they don't get it right BUT Madonna remains a beacon of challenge and hope.  Well done lady!
I have and have always had much respect and admiration for her.  Despite all the controversy and judgement she continues to stay the course and will always SHINE.   my hero!!!
Hi Debbie ! Your video made me very emotional. I am a professional mechanical engineer and i needed a proof to say i am not alone in this. Thank You !
We have been given on earth is so that we can foster a positive impact on the world in which we live.
What the hell not agreeing with homosexuality is? It’s like saying “I don’t agree with you being black” or “I don’t agree with you being Italian” or “I don’t agree with people who have skeletons”. Girl
i dont see any lives matter everyones going to die eventually i think mass random genocide would good for thebplanet and all of humanity to many people as it is. plus thats a lot of fertilizer for trees. its a win win. earth wins and then with less people more food for everyone else
Every life matters.
THIS IS SIMPLE!!!! THE HOLY BIBLE SPELLS IT OUT!!! ALL MANKIND IS MADE IN THE LIKE OF JESUS! MODERN SCIENCE DNA PROVED THE BIBLE RIGHT. THE HOLY BIBLE SAYS JESUS LOVE YOU! NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE DOES IT SAY A CERTAIN SKIN COLOR MATTERS. GET OFF THE BS PEOPLE! DEMONIC-RATS ARE WHORING FOR VOTES! DEMONIC-RATS ARE PRAYING ON YOUTH AND EMOTIONS. PATHETIC SCOURGE! EVERY WHERE DEMOCRATS RULE THEIR PEOPLE DO NOT THRIVE AND SUFFER NEGLECT. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE IS PROOF.
These people need to be protected at all costs
All Lives Matter. Communities that have failing schools
Conversion therapy has been linked to several deaths. You're in no position to judge whether or not he's a survivor.
@Sasha Dumse But rules are meant to be broken and I think god just wants people to be happy!
American royalty! Thanks Madge for always looking out for us!
That one kid is so cute God gave us a choice and my choice is to love
@Christina Lavinder More concerned about getting more women in STEM field rather than increasing the male graduation rate... So much for equality.
People need to stand out and protesting for All lives matter!
These kids gonna grow up to be very wholesome human beings becoz of these videos where they meet so many people who broaden their horizon..
I dont agree with homossexualitynnAGREE?nIts not something to you agree about. Its NOT.  nIts like  i dont agree with people with a head nBut-
Homosexuality is part of my happiness pills
But would she get the same publicity if she wasn't so so beautiful. This still perpetuates sexist double standards that rewards beauty in women and intelligence in men (though she obviously has both). I hope someday my daughter will be asked to give ted talk even if she doesn't look like a model.
I love crystal she is so understanding and accepting xxx
That's crazy... People like these who BEAT people with a bible give Christians a bad rap. Christianity means to love people not be even a little bit like this!!! That guy is so strong for being himself
My choice is to love. Immediately my eyes welled up
Black Lives Matters is the Real Urgency now! No need to downplay BLM with the obvious all lives matters which everyone is aware of. Duhh
Bad Democrats  are very bad very very bad they hurt the people they hurt the people they don’t care about people and it doesn’t nDoes it matter why skin dark skin look at what they doing to the people that live on the streets both parties they act like they don’t exist they act like they don’t exist I got nothing to do with color
Sunshine littlephilly I had just wanted to say that it’s completely okay and valid to be religious and also love and support the lgbtq. There is no changing what has been made by God
Every lives matter
All Lives Matter All The Time..
ALL LIVES MATTER ..IF YOU THINK OTHER WISE THEN YOU ARE RACIST..
Just seeing the title made me tear up a little. I am so glad that these kids are so open minded and are actually more intelligent than bible thumping adults. It's hard enough to come out of the closet but imagine going through all that pain and abuse.
I agree Hannity...All Lives Matter.
There are lgbtq persons who do bad things. Thats a given. But that shouldnt be the license to hate everybody else in the lgbtq sphere cause a lot of us are nice and righteous. Generalizing is what needs to go. Ps
When i try to coming out infronte of my parents they say will disown me and kick me out if I don't be streight and right now I lie them in the face and told them I am streight but I don't love a boy right now but actually I have a girlfriend and all my frends
ᗩᒪᒪ ᒪIᐯEᔕ ᗰᗩTTEᖇ!!!!!
Mesmerizing....! Bravo! Why no one came up with this earlier! The way we think the world is developing so fast yet it still manages to surprise us with its absurdity is plain staggering. Although I grew up to be an activist after majoring in social studies
All lives matter in Gods' eyes.
I'm a Buddhist...!    ALL LIVES MATTER...!
@Yvonne Terran at this point -- all live matter white blue pink black
Bruh All lives matter includes Black lives
The way I can relate to this lady though!!!  Thank you
ALL LIVES MATTER no matter the age or color or anything. Mutual respect Is the secret.
ALL lives matter. Regardless of color
I think she is an indigo spirit they are like angels but more aggressive like warriors because they are here to change the old outdated paradigms.
I watch this every time I need motivation in life.
If my friends came out and told me I would be like do  I look like I care what your sexuality is we will always be friends
this inspires me so much! thank you.
It is strange to hear about it. I am from Russia and my grandmothers are engineers
# Equality means all lives matter.n# Deep Deep down its not about color it's about the mind
She's a living legend. She changed the world. Madonna u are my life!
We all need to change..All Life's Matter..
I’m conservative and even I know that conversation therapy is horrible. Most conservatives will agree.
That little kid my choice is to love I almost cried oh my god
I am I bisexual Christian and I am so sorry to anyone that who has to deal with homophobic Christians. Most people in my church love and support me and others... It's the old people. They can't accept change and continue to be racist and sexist.
All lives matter and if you cant find yourself in that your racist
It's pretty simple. A large portion of the world is anti-gay and the parades are a way to show that gay people aren't going anywhere and demand the same rights that everyone else has.  It's especially useful for the gay teenagers that are put out onto the street by their christian families and feel like they dont belong anywhere. Being able to see that people like you are celebrating and proud of who they are when everyone around you wants to make you feel ashamed for being gay is something that saves lives.nnHope that answer explains part of it
This was great! Very motivational!!
All Lives Matter
She is genuinely a fighter for love
I'm shocked that it isn't illegal in the whole US. nI know it was a big thing
@Harris Cobb Because of the immense physical and psychological harm it does to those who are forced to go to such ineffective therapy.
Nursing is a female-dominated major because of societal pressure against the men who do it. When colleges tried to recruit males in nursing
Okay everyone’s so focused on her wording of She doesn’t agree with it but to me when you listen to everything else she says after that it sounds like she’s saying that she doesn’t see herself as being about to be homosexual but that she doesn’t mind that other people are homosexual and that she’ll love and respect them regardless
I have been very scared to tell my mom but she is very supportive with me but I still have my grandma to tell but I think I'm going to do that on my birth day in a couple of months
I’m a Mechatronics engineering student and I couldn’t be more happy studying something else !
This is all so sick. God is about love and he calls Christians to love everyone despite their sins
@Maggie Paul police brutality is a problem for ALL races.
Of course all lives matter. The ones who are against this are the real racist individuals. ALL LIVES MATTER!! Not only white nor black... every single live matters... ALL LIVES MATTER!! Saying BLM is fighting racism with racism... ALL LIVES MATTER!!
Never liked playing with Barbies or dress up really tbh. It was something I scarcely remember trying once or twice. All the dolls I got for my birthdays were never opened from their boxes.

Sitting with people and talking about important topics of society is child abuse to you? Sorry to break it to you but school does exactly the same.nAlso their parents are like right behind the camera
@Sasha Dumse that is true. But we should ALL love each other as God says.
Hope doesn’t happened at all that mean you deserve a nice home
You WILL become an engineer one day.nYou can become anything and everything you believe in.
Who inspires you to come out can be very personal. For me
Animal and plant lives matter too and when self-centered
I agree fully! it bothers me when a little boy can't even hold a doll because that's a toy for girls!. play with toy guns instead!. I don't think toys have any gender
I'm sorry but I can't respect a person who think homosexuality is wrong. I just can't.
All lives do matter not just black or white
Lonelymilanj are you for real...she did her work when no one else did.
All lives matter to God the Creator
WOW! Debbie. Bravo. I like that u said Guys were in the library at 3 am. It's obviously handwork that makes ppl ahead of others
Anja I was just wondering why you think 18 is too young. 12-13 is the average age that’s puberty starts and so that when you typically start to develop sexual feeling towards people. When were you sure that you were heterosexual? I’m not trying to be rude at all and I’m sorry if it comes off that way
I have said numerous times that God loves everyone
i don't know why the girls didn't apply for engineering..so cool to study and we always welcome female to study engineering ...
@mia lippert I appreciate the love babe!!! Keep spreading kindness and love. Hopefully
I love Madonna.  She truly is a freedom fighter and opened up doors for change.  She was such a bright light for many people and gave them hope in a time where being different seemed not even an option at times.
Love this video and I am a man. I'm glad that she doesn't pinpoint her blame for gender inequality on men. This is a feminist that I can back. It is society as a whole telling women they need to be princesses instead of engineers and doctors.
Madonna is very inspiring

Never liked playing with Barbies or dress up really tbh. It was something I scarcely remember trying once or twice. All the dolls I got for my birthdays were never opened from their boxes. That or they collected dust in my closet. I always found myself playing with my brother's legos and my animal toys. Or playing outside with my dinosaur figures and collecting rocks and plants. My dad got me a Bob the Builder tool box set and I loved that thing. As I did with the show. I remember seeing those TV ads selling plastic builder/workshop tool sets for boys and always wanting one myself. I would've loved Goldie Blocks if it was around when I was a kid. nnThis video was very inspirational. Intelligent and beautiful woman. Glad she never gave up. Im starting to get into engineering myself

Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It’s not only due to her provocative nature. I was waiting for Madonna to say that she is sexually fluid and/or bisexual when asked why she is such an advocate for the LGBT community. I’m not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.
